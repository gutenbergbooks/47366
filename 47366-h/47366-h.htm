<p class="main">Nervous Breakdowns and<br />
How to Avoid Them.</p>
<hr class="midi" />

<h2>CHAPTER <abbr title="1">I.</abbr><br />
<span class="sub_head">BREAKDOWNS IN GENERAL.</span></h2>

<p>An express train was on its way from London
to Edinburgh. It was running at sixty miles
an hour, and the passengers, as comfortable as if
they had been sitting in easy chairs by their own
firesides, were engaged in reading, sleeping,
talking or looking out of the windows. Not a
thought of any impending trouble crossed their
minds.</p>

<p>Suddenly they felt a jar, followed by a jerk;
the train slowed down, and within ten seconds had
come to a standstill. Then there was general
commotion, and heads appeared at every window,
to see or inquire what was the matter. There
was no station in sight, and no signal against
them. Yet that train, which a few moments
earlier had been speeding along in all its power
and pride, had come to a dead stop.</p>

<p>And when those passengers alighted from their
compartments and began to investigate matters,
they were no nearer a solution of the mystery.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
The train had not left the rails, the carriage
wheels were intact, the engine was undamaged,
the fires burning and the steam up. Yet
something had happened, and whatever it was,
it had rendered that train a useless mass of
timber and steel for the time being. It was still
a fine thing to look at, but as a means of
locomotion it was of no more use than a child’s
toy would have been.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
shock.</div>

<p>Yet, great as was the trepidation of those
passengers, it was nothing to the shock
experienced by the man who in the prime of life,
and perhaps just when he bids fair
to reach the heights towards which
he has been striving with all his
might for long years, suddenly finds
that he is incapable of the very work of which
he had prided himself he was master.</p>

<p>It may be that he has toiled since youth in order
to attain a certain position, and just when it
comes within his reach his nerve fails him, and he
cannot put out his hand to take it. The energy
and ability which have carried him so far along
the road fail him at the critical moment.</p>

<p>Or it may be that he has struggled through
laborious days and nights and amid many
disappointments for fame. Just as he is about
to realise his ambitions he breaks down, and
becomes an embittered misanthrope. The genius
which has enabled him to climb so many rungs
of the ladder becomes inert, and he cannot mount
the last step.</p>

<p>Another spends his life in a good cause&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>philanthropy,
religion, public work of any sort.
At the very time when, by the experience he has
gained, his years of greatest usefulness stretch
before him, he is cut off, incapacitated by nervous
debility.</p>

<p>And it is not only men who go through this
experience; the same may befall women. Often
has it happened that a woman has devoted herself
so assiduously to the care of her family, regardless
of her own disturbed meals and broken rest, that
just when her children needed her most of all&mdash;and
that is when they were growing up&mdash;her
strength has failed her and she has become
an invalid.</p>

<p>The lamentable part about breakdowns is the
fact that they attack those who can least be
spared. It is not the clodhopper, the navvy or
the labourer, the careless or the incompetent,
who suffer from them. On the contrary, we meet
with them among skilled workmen, business men
of the greatest ability, professional men of the
highest acumen and experience. The former can
be replaced, whilst these others have carved a
niche for themselves which no one else can fill.</p>

<p>It is the natures of finest fibre which accomplish
the most, and it is they who are most liable to give
way beneath the strain. A common mug may fall
to the ground unharmed, where a piece of costly
china would be smashed to atoms. When a
masterpiece of art is lost or stolen, the whole
nation grieves after it. How much more so when
a man of repute, either in great ways or small,
is invalided and his services lost to the world.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The problem
of the day.</div>

<p>There is no doubt that breakdowns constitute<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
one of the most momentous problems of the day.
We hear of them on all hands, in
different guises and under various
terms. Go into any company you
like, and it is safe to say that before
many minutes have passed matters of health will
be under discussion, and oftentimes they are
nerves or breakdowns in some form or other.</p>

<p>It is only natural, perhaps, that this should be so.
Yet too frequently the only result of these aimless
conversations is to accentuate suffering, instead
of leading to the acquisition of any useful
information which might help to relieve it.
Unfortunately, the general public seems to have
made up its mind that nervous disorders are an
inevitable concomitant of modern life. They fear
them just as they fear influenza, wondering who
will be the next to be attacked.</p>

<p>Yet there is no comparison between the two
complaints. For the one is due to a germ which
pounces upon the good and the bad, the wise and
the foolish, the thoughtful and the careless, with
absolute impartiality; whilst the other is brought
about by a number of conditions, all associated
with our mode of life, for which we are responsible,
and over which we have a vast amount of control.</p>

<p>Influenza comes like a bolt from the blue,
attacking its victims with disconcerting
suddenness. To be sure, breakdowns may appear,
in many cases at least, to come in a fell swoop;
but what seems so abrupt and unlooked for is
usually the climax to a long-continued process<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
of undermining, like the collapse of a house,
which has succumbed to the ravages of time.
Yet the events which have led up to it may have
been spread over a large number of years.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The nature
of a breakdown.</div>

<p>Occasionally we hear of someone who has been
disabled all of a sudden by some definite form of
ailment, paralysis, cancer or heart
disease, it may be. Such cases
are, however, the exception, and
they are not the breakdowns with
which we are now concerned. In
the great majority of instances “breaking down”
is the final stage of a long process of “running
down.” There is as much difference between the
two classes of cases as between an engine which
has come to a stop because a wheel has come off
or a connecting-rod broken, and one that has
become useless owing to neglect or prolonged wear
and tear.</p>

<p>The period of running down may last for months
or years, and it is characterised by various
symptoms, physical and nervous. It is the
former which are at the root of the matter, but
the others predominate more and more, until,
when the final breakdown occurs, they overwhelm
the bodily symptoms altogether. On this account
it is usually designated by terms expressing this
nervous element: nervous exhaustion or debility,
neurasthenia or simply nerves. Yet all these are
only different phases or stages of the same
complaint.</p>

<p>What, then, is the nature of this complaint?
It is one that has suffered from much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
misapprehension, chiefly through the use of the
term “nervous exhaustion.” This phrase has
given rise to an impression in the lay mind that
there is a limit to the nervous force with which
human beings are endowed, as though each one
started with a certain quantity which must come
to an end sooner or later.</p>

<p>This idea is a fallacy, for nervous energy is in
process of being manufactured every hour we live.
And Nature stores up out of this supply a reserve
from which we may draw in any emergency that
may demand a special output.</p>

<p>This reserve fund is constantly varying. It is
replenished during the hours of sleep, it is called
upon during the period of wakefulness.
Sometimes an extra call has to be made upon it.
A woman may have her night’s rest broken, or
she may even lose her sleep altogether for several
nights in succession. Or a man may have a
sudden stress of work which cannot be avoided.
Then the reserve may be depleted, but that does
not constitute a breakdown. If care is taken to
ensure sufficient rest afterwards, the surplus is
regained. It is only when a constant drain is put
upon it that serious damage results.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The two
types.</div>

<p>And in many cases of breakdown the question
of exhaustion plays no part. For most
neurasthenics show no loss of
energy; in fact, many of them
exhibit an increased output. The
crux of the whole matter is not
exhaustion, but a loss of control over the nervous
forces. This loss may show itself in two distinct<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
ways. It may either prevent the energy from
manifesting itself, or it may discharge it in a
spasmodic manner.</p>

<p>One market-day, in a country town, there were
two horses, both of which, so far as their utility
was concerned, were equally inefficient. Yet
neither were lacking in energy. The one was
excitable, plunging about to the danger of the
public, and in any direction except the right one.
The other was, on the contrary, perfectly quiet,
standing harnessed to a vehicle, but unable to move
it. This animal had strength and nerve force in
plenty, yet it was incapable of making use of it.
For a drunken ostler had harnessed it the wrong
way round, with its head towards the cart.</p>

<p>The same types can often be recognised in those
who suffer from nervous breakdown. Some
patients become fidgety and restless, rushing about
from pillar to post, worrying their employees
or their fellow-workers, and fussing around in the
home until the rest of the household dreads the
sight of them.</p>

<p>Others are precisely the opposite of this. They
become moody and taciturn, or disinclined to
meet their friends or take part in a conversation.
A woman will sit by herself most of the time,
not caring even to have her children about her.
A man will have a difficulty in making up his mind
not only on important points of business, but it
may be on the most trivial matters. He begins
to look at his work as stupidly as the aforesaid
horse stared helplessly at the cart he was supposed
to pull.</p>

<p>Where does the fault lie? Not in too much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
energy or too little, but in some derangement of the
system, whereby the patient’s faculties either go
astray or are rendered inert. And in order to
discover the real source of the mischief, it is
necessary to look, not at the climax, but farther
back, through a long sequence of events which have
been leading up to it.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER <abbr title="2">II.</abbr><br />
<span class="sub_head">THE DANGER SIGNAL.</span></h2>

<p>It will naturally be asked by what sign is a man
or woman to know when they are threatened with
a breakdown.</p>

<p>By no one sign in particular. One cloud does
not make a wet day. It is only when other clouds
begin to gather and we feel a certain change in the
atmosphere that we surmise that rain is coming.
The signs which warn us of the approach of a
storm are almost too indefinite for words.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Signs of a
breakdown.</div>

<p>The symptoms by which a man is led to think
he is on the verge of a breakdown are equally
vague. That is what makes them
all the harder to locate and to bear.
If he has sciatica, pleurisy or a
gumboil, he can speak of his
ailments and tell people what is the matter with
him. The neurasthenic has not even this
consolation. His symptoms are so indefinite that
he can scarcely find words in which to express
them; if he could do so, he would shrink from
mentioning them for fear that his friends would
laugh at him.</p>

<p>For it must be understood that neurasthenia
is a very different matter from hysteria or
hypochondriasis. The hysterical subject craves
for sympathy, and will imitate all sorts of ailments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
in order to secure it. The hypochondriacal
imagines he has all manner of diseases and loves
to talk about them to anyone who has the patience
to listen to his tale of woe.</p>

<p>The neurasthenics are the very opposite of this.
They are usually people of refined susceptibilities,
sensitive about themselves and their feelings.
They have, therefore, to bear their burden alone.
They see the clouds gathering on their mental
horizon and their sky getting darker and darker.
The future becomes laden with foreboding, and all
around there is the presentiment of a storm that
is about to break. Often they keep their feelings
to themselves, until at last these become of such
intensity that they can no longer be hidden. Such
persons often welcome a definite illness, if only
because it gives them something unmistakable
to speak about, affording them the opportunity
of calling in the medical aid of which&mdash;quite
wrongly, be it observed&mdash;they had previously
been ashamed to avail themselves.</p>

<p>We are sometimes told that headache, giddiness,
pains in the region of the spine, weak digestion
and a host of similar complaints are preliminary
signs of oncoming breakdown. Yet, whilst they
often accompany the latter condition, they are
also significant of many other ailments, which
have nothing to do with it. Sciatica may be
the result of a chill, spinal pains of an influenza
cold, whilst headache may be due to biliousness,
faulty eyesight or a variety of other conditions.
The fact that we suffer from any one of them does
not imply that we are threatened with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
breakdown. For all that, it is not well to neglect
these complaints, for it is certain that if we have
any tendency to nervous trouble they will hasten
it on.</p>

<p>To suggest, however, that such symptoms are
preliminary to a nervous collapse would be to
inspire, in the minds of many people, a sense of
terror which would precipitate the very disaster we
are anxious to avoid.</p>

<p>One thing, however, it is necessary to emphasise.
If any symptom of this sort&mdash;and the remark
applies especially to headaches&mdash;is found
consistently to come on during the hours of work,
alleviating after the work is over for the day, it
should be taken as a danger signal. For when
anyone’s occupation brings on a headache, the
complaint is much more likely to be due to some
weakness of the nervous system than to any fault
in digestion or eyesight. And the same applies
to many other symptoms also.</p>

<p>The phenomena I am about to describe are those
suggestive of nervous weakness, and any man or
woman who recognises themselves in the picture
I shall attempt to draw had better take warning.
They need not alarm themselves unduly, but they
will be well advised to pull up short.</p>

<p>There is one point which must always be kept
in mind. It does not follow that because a person
is easily tired, or is irritable or depressed or dreads
any ordeal awaiting him, or is nervous in any
direction, that he or she is drifting towards a
breakdown. It is when people who have previously
been free from such weaknesses find that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
they are acquiring them that they must face the
fact their nervous systems are on the down grade.
Each individual must be taken as his or her own
standard. What is natural for some would be
unnatural for others. A person is ill when he falls
below his own level of health, either of body or
mind. The various signs of neurasthenia or
breakdown depend, not on comparing a man with
anyone else, but in measuring him by his former
self.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Loss of
strength.</div>

<p>One of the most constant symptoms is a gradual
decline in strength, either of body or mind,
without any organic disease to account
for it. If a man whose heart,
lungs and kidneys have been proved
sound begins to suffer from fatigue
after an amount of exercise such as he would not
previously have noticed, everything points to the
fact of its being the result of some impairment in
his nervous system. More particularly so if the
tiredness is of an unpleasant nature. There is a
delightful form of fatigue and there is a painful one.
There is nothing more enjoyable than the gentle
aching which a healthy man feels as he stretches
out his limbs in a comfortable chair after a good
day’s walking, shooting, golf or whatever else it
may have been. He feels, in mind and body alike,
a delicious sense of half-sleepy lassitude, which
affords to a higher degree than anything else
a sense of repose and well-being.</p>

<p>That is very different from the weariness that
dogs a man’s footsteps wherever he goes, or is even
with him during his sleeping hours, so that he rises<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
in the morning more tired than when he lay down.
When that happens something in his organisation
has gone wrong.</p>

<p>Equally significant is the langour that attacks
people when they are following their daily avocations.
Of course, it is natural that as people grow
older they should find themselves less capable
of exertion than they were in their younger days.
Most persons over forty years of age have to take
things somewhat more quietly than before. They
are not so well able to run, and perhaps have to
walk more deliberately, but that is very different
from feeling fatigued when there has been no
justification for it. Yet even that is not a matter
of such gravity as when a man who has taken
a keen interest in his daily work, of whatever sort
it may be, discovers that it is becoming more and
more of an effort. Or it may be a woman, who
finds her household duties, which had hitherto
been a pleasure to her, becoming a bugbear. And
when anyone, either man or woman, begins to look
forward habitually with dread to the work of the
following day, their health is in sore need of
attention.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Worry.</div>

<p>Yet in most cases all that they do is to reproach
themselves for their indolence and apply
themselves to their duties still more
assiduously, with the usual result
that they worry themselves and
everybody else. And the harder they try the
worse things get, until at last the work in which
they had taken such a pride becomes a nightmare
to them. They begin to shrink from the thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
of it, yet it forces itself continually upon their
notice. Perhaps even the evenings, which should
bring a sense of refreshing and repose, are spoiled
by fretting over the events of the day that is gone
and worrying as to the work of the morrow;
the housewife in trepidation as to her duties in the
home, the workman to his job, the commercial
man to his business, the parson to his next
appearance in the pulpit.</p>

<p>The result is that in many cases the work suffers.</p>

<p>Worry and anxiety are the common lot of
mankind, at any rate in this age of stress and
competition. Yet it is not the common cares
of life which have a detrimental effect on the
human system, but this useless, exaggerated
vexation of spirit. When a man has lost the
power of leaving his worries behind him, it is time
that he began to take heed, for sooner or later they
will affect his work. If he allows himself to drift,
wasting his energies by futile struggling against
his own disabilities, his mental faculties will begin
to show signs of wear and tear.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Memory.</div>

<p>It may be that his memory will play him tricks,
words and facts failing him at the critical moments.
There is no surer sign of
neurasthenia than when a man who
has always been a ready speaker,
begins to hesitate for words in which to express
himself. The worst symptom of all is when
people noted for their firm, decisive characters
find themselves unable to make up their minds,
either on some subject of general interest or on
points connected with their own pursuits.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Pleasures
pall.</div>

<p>An even worse phase of fatigue is that which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
intrudes upon the hours of recreation. It is bad
enough for people to become unduly
tired at their work; it is worse when
they become tired at their play.
When amusements cease to afford
any gratification, and people lose interest in their
favourite hobbies and pursuits, their nervous
systems are perilously near a breakdown. This
weakness has passed into a further and a more
serious stage.</p>

<p>Then social intercourse is apt to weary them.
They find a difficulty in concentrating their
attention on a conversation, especially if the
subject under discussion happens to be one
demanding close attention. Sometimes, however,
even an ordinary chat will tire them out. It may
be that they are unable to read the lightest
literature, the effort to follow a story proves
too much for them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Change of
disposition.</div>

<p>In consequence of all this, they fall into a sad
plight. For not only are they deprived of the
solace of amusing themselves, but
their friends are apt to fight shy
of them. When people get into
this state they become ultra-sensitive,
and see slights and insults where none
were meant. They are liable to lose their sense of
humour too, and can neither appreciate nor take
a joke. After that, it is not long before they see
their friends deserting them, which means that
they are driven back upon themselves.</p>

<p>That, on the top of everything else, depresses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
them, and they worry still more over unnecessary
trifles. Probably they become sleepless, and that
will hasten on as nothing else can do the
inevitable climax.</p>

<p>Irritability of temper is often one of the first
signs of this malady, not of course in those who are
naturally quarrelsome, but in those who have
hitherto been of a genial, companionable
disposition. In fact, change of disposition is one
of the most significant features in nervous
breakdowns. A man who has always taken the
greatest pleasure in the society of his children
will begin to snap at them without any
cause. Their very presence seems to fidget
him.</p>

<p>His companions find it out, too, for not
uncommonly he begins to lose his temper when he
is beaten at a game, a thing he has rarely before
been known to do. But what is the clearest
danger signal of all is when men or women
see this irritability worming its way into the
solitude of their own thoughts. In one case of
neurasthenia the first sign consisted of the fact
that the patient found, whenever he was alone,
a tendency to have resentful and bitter thoughts
even of his best friends. Once or twice he even
cut his chin while shaving, simply because he was
feeling so angry with a chum, who had not given
him the slightest reason for animosity.
Sometimes it happens that a man who has not
been in the habit of swearing will find himself
using bad language in the course of his soliloquies.
Once he starts doing that, he may know, without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
any doubt whatsoever, that his nervous system
has gone wrong.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Increased
nervousness.</div>

<p>Increasing nervousness is a predominant feature
of neurasthenia. It appears in various guises.
A man who has never found any
difficulty in holding his own in his
dealings with others will suddenly
find himself looking forward to an
interview with fears and qualms. When the
time comes he may be able to string himself
up to the pitch, but it will only be by an effort
such as he is quite unaccustomed to, and the
nervous tension will perhaps leave him spent
and exhausted.</p>

<p>Others, who have never known the meaning of
the word nerves, will feel ashamed and angry with
themselves when they start at the sound of a
loud noise or a banging door, or are afraid to enter
a dark room.</p>

<p>Not infrequently it happens that people who
have been the first to welcome a friend in the street
will commence to make a practice of crossing the
road when they see anyone approaching.</p>

<p>Or their nervousness may take the form of a
fear of the unknown. The future becomes full of
dark spectres. Visions of poverty, even of the
workhouse itself, will attack a man whose financial
affairs are on a safe footing. A common sign of
disordered nerves is a constant dread of illness.
If an epidemic of influenza is prevalent, the
neurasthenic will feel certain that he is to be the
next victim, and his sensations, purely imaginary
it may be, will confirm his forebodings.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Loss of
zest.</div>

<p>In whatever way neurasthenia assails anyone,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
it has one certain effect. It deprives them of the
joy and zest of life, and when once
that has disappeared there is
little left. People have their
different temperaments. Some are
of a sanguine type, and it is no effort for them to be
blithe and gay. Others are cast in a more sombre
mould; not that they are thereby miserable, for
such people can enjoy themselves as much as
anyone else, but in a quieter way. But when
their nervous system shows signs of damage, they
lose their sense of contentment just as the others
lose their flow of vivacity.</p>

<p>All these are the premonitory signs of a
breakdown, and if they are neglected the crash may
come. The man finds that he cannot face his
work, the woman is unable to carry out her duties
in the home. Life becomes dark and void, and all
that made it worth living seems to have gone.</p>

<p>Then too often they are assailed by the worst
dread of all, the fear that they will lose their
reason. For their comfort we may say that,
tragic as a breakdown may be, there is a wide
gulf between it and insanity.</p>

<p>And those who are in the preliminary stages,
and have not arrived at that of a breakdown, may
console themselves with the fact that the latter
is one of the most preventable of conditions. It
is the aim of this book to show the different
ways in which it may be avoided.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER <abbr title="3">III.</abbr><br />
<span class="sub_head">HEALTH.</span></h2>

<p>It is surprising, in these days when everybody is
an authority on matters of health, how few
people there are who can tell you what it really
is. The majority, if asked to describe it, would
probably say that a man is healthy when he is
not ill.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Health, not
illness, the
standard.</div>

<p>Now when you come to analyse this statement,
it conclusively shows one thing, namely that
people take illness as the standard.
Most human beings, in civilised
countries at any rate, have something
the matter with them&mdash;a
weak digestion, tendency to sore
throats or colds, or a predisposition to ailments
of one sort or another.</p>

<p>Yet the fact that most people suffer from illness
is no reason for calling it a natural condition. It
is health that is natural; illness is an anomaly.
Medical men themselves are the first to recognise
the truth of this statement. Animals as a rule
are sound and vigorous so long as they are in a
wild state. It is only when they are in captivity
that they become delicate. Similarly savages are
much freer from disease than civilised races. It
is when they live in artificial surroundings that
they become prone to sickness.</p>

<p>Health is not a negative thing. It is a state<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
in which every part is sound and acts in harmony
with every other part.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The nature
of health.</div>

<p>A motor-car consists of a great
number of different parts&mdash;the gear,
the engine, the petrol supply, the
firing. It is not sufficient that each section
should be in good order. For each must also fit
in, both mechanically and in point of time, with
every other. The petrol pipe may be clear, but
unless the spark reaches the cylinders exactly in
the nick of time there will be misfiring, and a loss
of power in consequence.</p>

<p>This loss of power is not the only harm done.
It means that there will be unnecessary friction
also, causing extra wear and tear to the engine and
gear. If this occurs but seldom, and is put right
at once when detected, little damage may be
done. If repeated often, and allowed to go on
uncared for, the whole structure of the car will
suffer and the life of the machine be shortened.</p>

<p>It does not follow that the car will come to a
standstill. It will continue to run, but badly.
For like every other engine, it has the faculty of
compensation. That is to say, when one part is
out of order other parts will take on some of its
work, and help, for a time at least, to make good
the deficiency.</p>

<p>For instance, in a four-cylinder car one of the
cylinders may cease to act. Yet the other three
will take on a certain part of the work, and help
to some extent to make up the deficiencies of the
faulty one.</p>

<p>This will be only for a time, however, for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
additional strain will slowly but surely have a
bad effect on the rest of the engine, and through
it on the other parts of the machine. One by
one these will give way, and have to be compensated
in turn. If still neglected and left to
take care of itself, there will come a time when so
many sections are affected, that the remainder
cannot overcome the mischief, and compensation
will fail. The car will become practically useless.
Perhaps, like the one-hoss shay, it will collapse
<i>en masse</i>. It has gone beyond the stage of
running badly, it has broken down.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The human
machine.</div>

<p>The human system is much like a motor-car,
in that it consists of a vast number of parts acting
in unison. Yet it is infinitely more
wonderful, for it is much more
complicated, and can create its own
supply of energy. It is made,
roughly speaking, of a framework of bone and
muscle, a delicately-adjusted alimentary system,
whereby it takes in and assimilates food, and of a
circulatory apparatus which drives blood and
nourishment to all parts of the body. It contains
also a nervous system, compared with which these
other parts are crude, mechanical contrivances.
For it is on their nervous supply that they depend
for their usefulness. Cut the nerves that go to a
limb, and the finest muscles in the world are as
helpless as the meat in a butcher’s shop. Deprive
the heart of its nerve supply for a single minute,
and it will never beat again.</p>

<p>Yet we pay vastly more attention to a weak<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
heart, as it is called, or still more so to a broken
leg, than we do to a threatened failure in the
nervous system, which outweighs them all in
importance. Once that has got out of order, the
driving power is gone. Not only the heart and
muscles, but every other faculty we possess loses
its energy and usefulness.</p>

<p>So closely allied, however, are the different
parts, that the nervous system itself, which
governs all else, is dependent for its welfare on the
very organs it governs. Like the power of a king,
it rests not only on its own intrinsic qualities,
but also on the strength and harmony of the units
over which it rules.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Interplay.</div>

<p>And there is a constant interplay going on
between the various parts of the body. No one
organ or system can stand alone.
If it is working badly, it affects
other parts, and disturbs the
harmony on which the health of the whole depends.</p>

<p>One of the most marked examples of this is to
be found in the action and reaction which take
place between the digestive organs and the nervous
system. The presence of congenial company at
meal-times is one of the best aids to digestion; a
cantankerous discussion is the very opposite.
Similarly, if a man sits down to his dinner with a
grievance or a worry on his mind, it is safe to
predict dyspepsia.</p>

<p>A lady once received a telegram containing
disastrous news just as she was finishing a meal.
Up to that time she had never known what
indigestion was, yet for the next couple of days<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
she suffered from it in a most acute form. The
nervous shock had thrown the stomach out of
order, inhibiting the secretion of gastric juice.</p>

<p>We cannot help troubles of this sort, but it is
only once in a lifetime, perhaps, that we get a
message of that sort during the progress of a
meal. It is to be feared, however, that it is of
almost daily occurrence for some people to sit
down to table worrying over the business of the
day. And the accumulated effects of these minor
disturbances may in the long run prove more
detrimental than one big one.</p>

<p>Conversely, the stomach has an equally potent
influence over the nervous system. Everyone
knows that when their digestion is out of order,
and they are feeling uncomfortable or bilious,
their heads are not so clear as usual. And with
this there is a feeling of langour and irritability,
and a difficulty in doing work efficiently. This
is because the body fails to get its proper supply
of nourishment, and also because it is poisoned
at the same time. In order to understand the
manner in which this is brought about, it is
necessary to know something as to the events
which are taking place throughout the body every
moment of our lives.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Combustion
and
elimination.</div>

<p>When food is taken it is first digested and then
passes out of the stomach, and is carried by
means of the circulation to all
parts of the body. It nourishes
the various tissues, replacing the
loss which is constantly going
on.</p>

<p>For there is throughout the whole system a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
process corresponding to combustion, and this
combustion, like the furnace of an engine, is the
source of our energy.</p>

<p>As in an ordinary fire, ashes are produced in
the form of waste matter of a poisonous nature.
This waste must be removed from the tissues,
else it interferes with the process, as a neglected
fire is apt to become choked up and burn badly.</p>

<p>This removal is also accomplished by the
circulation. In any community you may see on
any ordinary working day two sets of carts, those
belonging to tradesmen which distribute groceries
and vegetables, and the scavengers’ carts which
gather up the refuse. The same processes go on
in the human body, with the difference that in this
case the same agency which brings the supplies
also carries away the waste.</p>

<p>These impurities are eliminated from the body
by means of the lungs, the skin, the kidneys and
bowels. And in order that this elimination may
be sufficient, the circulation must be maintained
in all parts of the body. Unless the blood is kept
moving, this waste matter will tend to collect
somewhere or other and give rise to trouble.
The way in which this motion is kept up is by
exercise, which squeezes out the fluid like an
automatic sponge. If the body was kept perfectly
still for weeks, it would became loaded with this
impure material, as a room that is shut up is
found to collect, in such a surprising manner, dust
and dirt.</p>

<p>When it reaches the lungs it is purified by means<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
of the air. For the air which we exhale is very
different from that which is breathed in, the
former being charged with impurities. The
drowsy feeling which we experience in a crowded,
ill-ventilated room is due entirely to the influence
of these toxic gases. The purer the atmosphere
we breathe, the more effective it is in carrying off
impurities from the blood, so that fresh air and
hygiene are essential to health, whilst exercise acts
as a valuable adjunct by increasing the respirations.</p>

<p>Yet exercise itself, important as it is, needs to
be carried out in moderation. For the muscles,
whilst fulfilling the vital functions just enumerated,
produce a poison of their own, if exertion be too
violent or prolonged. The severe cramp from
which athletes are liable to suffer is due to an
accumulation of this toxin.</p>

<p>This poison is eliminated from the system
during repose, and especially during sleep. Rest
is therefore as requisite as exercise itself, and
unless the body gets regular rest and sufficient of
it, severe damage may result. The muscles will
not only become permeated with their own
peculiar poison, but will be so enfeebled as to be
unable to assist in discharging the waste matter
which is constantly being formed throughout the
whole system.</p>

<p>These impurities are the source of many of the
ills with which mankind is afflicted&mdash;headaches,
vague pains in various parts, languor, and the
great majority of rheumatic troubles. But their
worst effect of all is that which they exert on the
nervous organisation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Waste matter
and the
nervous
system.</div>

<p>For the ramifications of the nervous system<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
penetrate to every part of the body, including the
internal organs. From its seat of
honour in the brain and spinal
cord it sends its messages to every
tissue in the body, and receives
messages in return. It may be
compared to an electric power
station, which distributes its current to every
part of a town. But with this difference, if the
electric light in a house goes wrong, it does not
affect the main station, whereas if any portion of
the body however small or insignificant gives way,
it adversely affects the central parts of the nervous
system. And if the various sections and organs
do not work together smoothly, the nervous
system, which governs them all, suffers along
with them.</p>

<p>The nervous system suffers in two ways when
the internal organs and other parts of the body
fail to do their work properly.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Starvation.</div>

<p>First of all, it languishes from starvation. This
does not mean that the individual is not taking
sufficient quantity of food. He
may be taking enough, even too
much, but it is not being digested
or assimilated satisfactorily, and though there is
plenty of food there is a deficiency of nutriment.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Poisoning.</div>

<p>Secondly, it may suffer from poisoning. This
may be the result of dyspepsia, for when food lies
in the stomach undigested, it is
apt to ferment, producing a poison
that circulates throughout the body.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
Or it may be because the impurities, which are
found throughout the whole body, are not being
got rid of, owing to a want of exercise and fresh
air. Or it may be owing to undue wear and tear
in consequence of a lack of sufficient rest.</p>

<p>Too often it is a combination of the two
processes, the nervous system being attacked by
starvation and poisoning at the same time.</p>

<p>The whole of man’s structure is a marvellous
automaton, and once the nervous element is
disturbed the trouble which first upset the
harmony is increased tenfold.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Compensation.</div>

<p>Yet the mischief may not be apparent all at
once, for the whole organisation is so accurately
balanced that defects in one part
will be compensated for by other
organs. And whilst this is a safeguard
in one way, it is a serious
menace in another. For the fault is apt to be
overlooked, until at last the process has gone on
to such an extent that the balance is upset. The
machine does not stop running, but, like a motor-car
in similar circumstances, it begins to run badly.
The man himself becomes what is called “run
down.”</p>

<p>It is a provision of Nature that the nervous
system, being the mainspring of our existence,
holds out longer than any other structure in the
body. If it did not do so most of us would have
been dead or broken down long ago. Yet it
means that when the loss of balance reaches such
a point that compensation fails, the breakdown is
all the more disastrous.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The cause
of the
breakdown.</div>

<p>Then, when the crash comes, we blame our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
nerves, our civilisation, our worries and troubles,
our heredity, anything in short
except ourselves. Of course, there
are cases in which circumstances
have entered over which the patient
has had no control. Sometimes
neurasthenia follows a severe illness or a bad
accident. Sometimes it comes on at critical
periods of life. And in some instances heredity
has played a part. There are some unfortunate
individuals who have been born with weak frames
and little stamina, so that even the ordinary
conditions of life, however favourable, prove
too much for them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
Remedy.</div>

<p>Such cases are the exception. In the great
majority of instances the faults which have
undermined the system are the results of mistakes,
either through ignorance or thoughtlessness, in
the mode of life. Not necessarily, observe, a
vicious mode of life. The victims may have been
consistently sober and virtuous. Yet they may
have been guilty of egregious errors in regard to
the quantity or quality of the food they have
taken, or the way in which they have eaten it
or in their neglect of fresh air, exercise or rest.
The fault may lie in any one of these elements,
or in more than one; in all of them, perhaps.
And it is only by close examination of the habits
of life that the source of the mischief
can be brought to light. In like
manner the treatment of nervous
breakdowns consists in remedying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
these faults, once they have been ascertained.
Patients seldom understand this fact. What
they particularly desire is a tonic to restore their
jaded energies, on the principle, evidently, of
whipping up a tired horse to make him go.</p>

<p>They look for some patent food which shall
build them up in marvellous manner. Articles of
this sort are valuable aids in cases where starvation
from lack of sufficient food has been the cause of
the trouble. But where there has been an error
in diet, it has been, in an overwhelming proportion
of cases, an excess of food rather than a lack of
it, and when this has been so, it is about as rational
to give such remedies, as it would be to pile more
coals on to a fire that was already choked.</p>

<p>It is not sufficient merely to treat individual
symptoms, taking phenacetine for headache,
pepsin for indigestion, and so forth; for that is
but to touch the fringe of the matter, leaving the
real secret of the trouble undealt with.</p>

<p>Neither is it of any use to tell the sufferer that
there is nothing the matter, that all he requires
is to rouse himself or cease his restlessness, as the
case may be. You might as well tell a drowning
man who cannot swim to buck up and be cheerful.</p>

<p>The rest cure, so much in vogue, may have its
advantages in some cases, but too frequently the
patient leaves the institution only to resume his
former mode of life, and repeat the very mistakes
which brought on the illness. A consumptive
might as well never enter a sanatorium if he is to
return to a badly-ventilated house and unwholesome
surroundings.</p>

<p>Not uncommonly it happens that a man will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
make up his mind to have a course of treatment
at some spa, even though it means a sacrifice of
time and money. When he is told that it is his
manner of life that needs overhauling, the commonplaceness
of the observation affronts him. Like
Naaman, he expects to be sent, if not to the
waters of Jordan, at any rate to those of Homburg
or some such resort, and he strongly objects to
being told that all he needs he can get at home.</p>

<p>Some time ago I was travelling from London
to Buxton. There were two other men in the
carriage, and one of them was telling the other
that he was going there for his health. He said
that he found it necessary to go several times a
year, as he got so run down. The other man
asked him what treatment he had on these
occasions, did he have baths or drink the waters
or what?</p>

<p>“No,” answered the first one, “I simply get
up early and go to bed in good time and take
plain food.”</p>

<p>“And why don’t you do it at home instead?”
inquired the other.</p>

<p>There was no reply.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER <abbr title="4">IV.</abbr><br />
<span class="sub_head">THE VALUE OF HEALTH.</span></h2>

<p>The supreme value of good health is the fact
that it is associated with happiness and a greater
capacity for good work.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Health
and
happiness.</div>

<p>It is not our environment but our state
of health which handicaps us. Mark Tapley
succeeded in ejaculating “jolly”
under the most depressing circumstances.
I know nothing as to
Mark’s medical history, but I should
not hesitate to affirm that he did
not suffer from a disordered liver.</p>

<p>Everything in this world varies according to
the way it is looked at, and we are all liable to
develop mental astigmatism when we are not
feeling up to the mark. A man will say and do
things that are foreign to his nature when he is
waiting in impatient hunger for his dinner.
Wives who are wise have found this out, and
wait until the brute has been fed before they
broach the subject of a new hat.</p>

<p>A man who has nothing special to worry him,
and who if any difficult position arose would face
it without flinching, will brood over his affairs
during the hours of a sleepless night until he has
created troubles enough to last him for the rest
of his life. His business may be running like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
clockwork, but before morning he will have
convinced himself that he is on the road to the
workhouse. A good night’s rest, a brisk walk,
even a cup of tea will work wonders in a careworn
man or woman, who has almost come to the
conclusion that life was not worth living.</p>

<p>One of the most prominent symptoms of
jaundice is the depression which accompanies
that malady. There is a solid substratum of
truth in the old saying, “Looking at the world
through jaundiced eyes.”</p>

<p>The most trying part of nursing sick people
is the cantankerousness which even the best-tempered
persons tend to develop when they are
ill or in pain. The most considerate of patients
are apt to become positively unreasonable at such
times. Yet because of their sufferings they need
all the sympathy and patience that can be
bestowed upon them. And as a rule, so long as
they are really ill and laid aside, they get it.
What the world gets sick of is the croaker, who
never ceases talking about his ailments. People
may sympathise with him for a time, but before
long they get tired of hearing about his complaints.
It is only human nature to prefer listening to
skylarks rather than to frogs.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Health
and work.</div>

<p>Perhaps the most serious effect of ill-health is
the loss of confidence which it entails. Many
a man of frail physique and little
stamina has been left behind by
others not nearly so richly endowed
with skill or intellectual ability.
He has the accomplishments, but not the power<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
to use them. He is so afraid of making mistakes,
that the psychological moment has gone past
before he has made up his mind, and time after
time he fails to take the tide at the flood.</p>

<p>Trace back the history of characters such as
this, and you will find that in almost all cases
they have been weakly boys, who on account of
their lack of vigour and health were always
afraid to take the plunge. They might learn to
swim, but they could not learn to dive.</p>

<p>A rising young Member of Parliament was once
asked what quality was most indispensable for
success in the House of Commons? Some expected
him to say the art of speaking, others the faculty
of rapid thinking, others again firmness of convictions.
All were surprised when he replied,
“Good bodily health. That,” he said, “was
more important than anything else.”</p>

<p>When you come to analyse that statement, it is
found to imply more than the strength to endure
the enervating atmosphere of the House or the
tedium of long sittings. It means that if a man
is well and strong he is able to seize every opportunity
of speaking, or otherwise showing his
capabilities and making use of them. Good
health is not merely a valuable asset in itself, it
unlocks the door of all the other faculties.</p>

<p>Most of us are not going into Parliament, but
most of us have to make our living. And no
matter in what way we have to do it, whether by
artisanship, business or professional career, vigour
and robustness are essential to success.</p>

<p>An employer when about to engage a hand will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
most certainly give the preference to a candidate
who looks strong and seems in good spirits. And
this for more than mere consideration as to
workmen’s compensation. For we have all
learned to associate cheerfulness with ability. If
a man undertakes a job as if he enjoys it, even
if it is only a plumber mending a kitchen sink, we
naturally conclude that he knows what he is
about. If on the other hand he looks worried, we
suspect that he has come across difficulties that
he does not understand. If he seems to have no
confidence in himself, we cease to have any
confidence in him.</p>

<p>We are all more inclined to extend our patronage
to a tradesman who serves with a beaming smile
than to one who looks as if he would be thankful
to see the last of us.</p>

<p>And in any avocation good health goes a long
way by contributing that quiet contentment of
mind which is a <i>sine qua non</i> to the attainment
of excellence.</p>

<p>It is a dictum in the medical profession that
you can always tell the state of a surgeon’s
digestion by the amount of confidence with which
he makes his incisions.</p>

<p>The parson who enters the pulpit with an air
of robust vigour is vastly better calculated to
secure the attention of his hearers than one
who crawls in looking as if he wished it were
all over.</p>

<p>A man who is at the head of a large business
awoke one morning feeling out of sorts. His
breakfast disagreed with him, and he arrived at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
his destination in a state of irritability. Then
he rapped out at his subordinates until he had
flurried them to such an extent that they could not
do their work properly. And of course after that
everything else went wrong. When he was called
on to come to a decision in regard to an important
contract, he got the worst of the bargain simply
through lack of a little tact. Yet ordinarily he
was noted for powers of dealing, and for a judgment
that was rarely at fault. That day he was
the victim of his own stomach.</p>

<p>Want of stamina has deprived the world of
some who might have done much to ease its woes
and help its advancement. For it effectually
limits the sphere of a man’s operations. There
are some of conspicuous ability who have had to
waste their talents in some quiet backwater, when
had they but had the requisite amount of strength
they might have occupied a prominent place in
public affairs. Young men who have possessed
every other fitting quality have been rejected for
the missionary cause because their health was
not good enough to stand the hardships of such
a life.</p>

<p>Some may ask as to whether good work has not
been done by those crippled by ill-health.
Undoubtedly it has been done, yet as a rule it has
been by those endowed with talents which
enabled them to carry out their work in seclusion&mdash;writers,
poets, composers and so forth&mdash;not by
those compelled to take their place among the rank
and file in the busy world of men and things. Too
often in the latter case they have fallen behind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
and been submerged. Even if success has been
their lot, it has been at such a cost to mind and
body alike as to make it scarcely worth the
while.</p>

<p>Yet even those who have been in the fortunate
position of being able to exercise their talents in
solitude, far from the madding crowd, have
betrayed the influence of their infirmities in the
nature of their works. Schubert and Chopin both
wrote exquisite music, yet their weak state of
health still reveals itself in the melancholy strain
which pervades their compositions. The same is
characteristic of some of the writers and poets.
Robert Louis Stevenson is the great exception.
But the disease which attacked him in his young
days, and dogged his steps mercilessly to the end
of his life, was one that is oftentimes, strangely
enough, characterised by buoyancy and enthusiasm,
in marked contrast to the prevailing
depression of the confirmed dyspeptic, of which
Carlyle was such a marked example. Yet what
chiefly enabled Stevenson to keep up the vigour
and inimitable style of his writing to the day of
his death was the unremitting care which he took
in order to regulate his life in such a way as to
preserve his energies and keep his mental powers
intact to the very end. That last broken sentence,
the most pathetic ever written, in <cite>Weir of
Hermiston</cite>, is more than an expression of his great
genius; it is a lasting tribute to the vigilance
with which he safeguarded such strength as he
possessed. It is a lasting reproach to those who
have been gifted with robust health, and by their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
own heedlessness have lost what is man’s most
priceless possession. People may disregard the
laws of health and appear for a time to go unscathed.
But the day of retribution will come,
and outraged Nature assert itself. Sooner or later
the inevitable penalty must be paid.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER <abbr title="5">V.</abbr><br />
<span class="sub_head">REWARDS AND PENALTIES.</span></h2>

<div class="sidenote">The health-seeker.</div>

<p>Some people expect health, as others expect
riches, to fall into their lap. Either because
they do not know, or do not care,
they prefer to leave their health
to look after itself. They call it
trusting to Nature. And when they
see other people studying the best way to be strong
and well, they call them cranks and faddists.</p>

<p>There is a vast difference, however, between
the faddist and the genuine health-seeker. The
individual who thinks the world is going to be
saved by eating brown bread or any other article
of diet, regardless of the fact that what agrees with
one may upset another, is nothing short of a
nuisance. The man who strives to exercise his
common sense, and to find out what suits him,
either from his own experience or from the advice
of those in a position to give him useful information,
is worthy of all respect.</p>

<p>It is all very well to talk of leaving things to
Nature, but does Nature always do her work in the
best possible way?</p>

<p>Leave a garden to Nature for a year, and you
will have a clear answer to that question. It will
be overgrown with weeds. Leave a tract of
country to Nature, and it becomes a wilderness.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
Leave your health to Nature, and it will be nothing
short of a miracle if she does not make a mess of it.</p>

<p>Talk to any elderly man, who has succeeded
in keeping himself fit and strong, and almost
certainly you will find that he has well-defined
ideas on the maintenance of health. He has
found out what agrees with him and what does
not. Sometimes he appears to be careless as to
what he eats, taking things that would disagree
with many other persons. Yet he is only taking
them because he has discovered that they suit his
constitution. Moreover, you will notice, if you
watch him closely, that he is extremely particular
as to the way in which he eats that food and all
his other food as well. A man is either a physician
or a fool at forty, it is said. The worst of it is
that by the time most of us have reached that
age we have managed to inflict more harm than
can be undone.</p>

<p>Nowadays nearly everything is taught in the
schools, including perhaps a few subjects that
might well be spared. When the teaching of
health is made compulsory, we shall make rapid
strides in regard to national physique. The
medical inspection of schools was one of the
greatest advances ever made. And when in
addition every child is instructed in the elementary
rules of health, the country will be spared a vast
amount of time and money, such as is expended
at present in looking after the feeble and diseased.
We do not expect a boy or girl to learn any other
subject on its own account or of its own freewill,
and we have no right to expect them to learn the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
secrets of health. They must be taught them
just as they are taught to read and write. Above
all, they must have it impressed upon them that
health is largely a matter of care and study.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The reward
of care.</div>

<p>The reason why some people are stronger than
others is, in the great majority of cases, because
they have taken care of themselves,
rather than because they
have inherited more robust frames
and greater staying powers. There
are some, it is true, who have to struggle against
ill-health from their earliest childhood. All
through life, it may be, they have to contend
against their own infirmities.</p>

<p>Yet not uncommonly it has turned out that
those who have been handicapped from the start
have in the long run passed their more robust
comrades. It is not always the healthy baby that
develops into the hardiest member of the family.
The puny little one has been known to have the
best of it in regard to health by the time it has
grown up.</p>

<p>And when this happens it is simply a reward
for taking care. Parents are bound to pay more
attention to a weakly child, while the robust ones
are often left to take their chance, and as they
grow up into boyhood and manhood, the delicate
one has still to exercise care and look after his
health, if only for his own comfort. He knows,
even in his schooldays, that if he eats too much
pastry or sweets, or neglects to change his clothes
if he gets a wetting, he will have to suffer for it.
All this time his hardy brother is running all sorts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
of risks, and playing ducks and drakes with his
digestion and his constitution in general.</p>

<p>When they are approaching middle age, the
strong one has developed into a gouty, dyspeptic
individual, who does not know what it is to feel
well for a single week at a time. And the weakly
one may be better and stronger than he has ever
been in his life before.</p>

<p>He has never been able to do anything by leaps
and bounds, but he has plodded steadily on,
exercising care and common sense, and looking
after his health in every possible way. It is
another example of the hare and the tortoise.</p>

<p>Two men were crossing a ship’s gangway, which
had a rail at one side but was unprotected on the
other. The first was a frail, nervous man, while
his friend who followed him was a strong, lusty
fellow. The delicate one took care to keep a firm
grip on the rail. He reached the ship’s side in
safety. The second man disdained to avail
himself of its aid, and walked up the gangway with
his hands in his pockets, paying no heed to his
steps. Suddenly he lost his balance and fell into
the water.</p>

<p>He scrambled out and cursed his bad luck.
“He was the most unfortunate beggar that ever
lived,” he said. He completely lost sight of the
fact that it was his own carelessness which had
brought about the mishap.</p>

<p>And it is a common occurrence to hear people,
who have been running all sorts of unnecessary
risks, complaining of their bad fortune when
illness overtakes them. They get wet through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
and sit in their damp clothes, and are very much
aggrieved when they take a chill. Or they gorge
themselves with pastry or sweetmeats, and consider
themselves martyrs when they suffer from a
bilious attack.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The inevitable
penalty.</div>

<p>There is one penalty ever before us, that which
must be paid by all who transgress the laws of
health. I say penalty, not punishment.
A boy who has purloined a
plum cake and eaten inordinately
of it may obtain his mother’s
forgiveness, but the chances are that he will be
penalised by having to endure a bout of stomach-ache.</p>

<p>In all this I have no wish to imply that those
who disregard the laws of health do so from
self-indulgence. On the contrary, the great
majority of breakdowns occur in those who have
overtaxed their strength whilst toiling to support
their wives and families, or to minister to the
welfare or comfort of those around them, or
to labour in some way or other on behalf of
humanity.</p>

<p>In a Midland town two young parsons worked
side by side. One of them was a genial sort of
fellow, who seemed to have plenty of time for
everything, work and play alike. When his
labours were over for the day, people enjoyed
having him in for a bit of supper and a chat.</p>

<p>On bright days, Mondays particularly, he would
mount his bicycle or shoulder his golf clubs, and
set off to have a good time of it. His doings
were a puzzle to his confrère, who never had a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
minute to spare, and rushed at his work, sermon-making,
visiting, and meetings alike, with feverish
anxiety. Even his meals were hurried through
in the same manner, for those, like recreation, he
regarded as an interference with his duties.</p>

<p>When his daily work came to an end, he would
proceed to make up for lost time by reading or
writing till long after midnight, with the result
that such sleep as he got when he went to bed was
simply the broken sleep of brain exhaustion.</p>

<p>Little wonder that he always looked strained
and anxious, and that when he went into the
pulpit on Sundays he failed to get into touch with
his hearers. With all his unceasing efforts, he
could not but realise that his friend had a vastly
greater hold on the people than he was ever able
to acquire. Then he would conclude that it must
be due to some fault in himself, and would begin
to look for it in the wrong place, viz. in his own
soul. It must be some black place in his own
heart, he thought, which was hindering his
work.</p>

<p>Now when a man indulges in too much
introspection he is very liable to develop a morbid
conscience, and see evil in himself that is purely
imaginary. Hypochondriacs of any sort are a
nuisance both to themselves and other people,
but none more so than the spiritual
hypochondriac. The consequence of these heart-searchings
was that he would increase his efforts,
and try to squeeze more work into the day.</p>

<p>He was sitting at breakfast one day scanning
the morning paper, when a head-line attracted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
his notice, “Death of the Rev. X. Y.” The paragraph
described how X. Y., whom the young
parson had always taken as his model for energy
and unremitting toil, had had to relinquish his
duties owing to a nervous breakdown, brought
on by overwork and the lack of holidays or
recreation of any sort.</p>

<p>The young man’s eyes dilated with horror as he
went on reading and realised the unmistakable
fact that X. Y. had brought about his own death.
The thought that such a fate might one day be
his own sent a shudder through him, especially
when it dawned upon him that he had been doing
his work on precisely the same lines as those
which had culminated in this tragedy.</p>

<p>It is not often that a man is so fortunate as to
have such an object-lesson as this. More
frequently he is allowed to persist in ways which
lead, if not to a disaster like the one referred to,
at any rate to a breakdown, which puts a stop to
his career of usefulness.</p>

<div class="sidenote">No account
of motives.</div>

<p>No matter how lofty may be the motives,
Nature takes no account of them. She is a
jealous mistress, and insists on
having her due share of attention,
allowing of no excuses. The
mother who neglects her own needs
through attending to the wants of her children
will suffer equally with the silly girl who starves
herself in order to keep her figure slim.</p>

<p>If a man stands out in the driving rain, he is
equally susceptible to cold, whether he stood
there in order to watch a football match or to take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
part in an evangelistic meeting. It is as injurious
to sit in a draught in a church as in a music-hall.
A stuffy atmosphere is no less detrimental to
health whether we encounter it whilst visiting
a sick friend or in spending the time in a gambling
den.</p>

<p>Two of the worst cases of breakdown which
I ever heard of occurred respectively in the case
of a working man, who had starved himself in the
necessaries of life in order to bring up three
orphan nephews and nieces, and in that of a
young professional man, who sat up every night
for weeks, after doing his work by day, to nurse
his wife through a dangerous illness.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Health lies
in our own
hands.</div>

<p>There are hundreds of people drifting towards
a breakdown, not because of their circumstances
or the nature of their avocation,
but because of the way in which
they choose to live and do their
work. Health is a matter that lies
in our own hands to a far greater
extent than is usually supposed. All who wish
to fulfil their mission in life to the best of their
ability, and maintain their power of work as long
as possible, must keep one eye on their work and
the other on their health. Whilst doing their
duty to others, they must not fail to do justice to
themselves.</p>

<p>I once saw two men playing golf, both of whom
were men of fame. One was a writer of repute,
the other an orator whose name is known far and
wide. They played round with an abandon and
zest that was refreshing to witness. But what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
impressed me most was a remark made by one
of them when they came in.</p>

<p>“My friend and I were anxious to get a game
to-day,” he said, “because we are the principal
speakers at two mass meetings to-night, and the
people are expecting something special, so we
must be prepared to let them have it.”</p>

<p>That was why, instead of immersing themselves
in studious solitude, rehearsing their speeches,
they spent the time in playing a game like a
couple of schoolboys out for a holiday, with
a good tea and a rest to follow. It is a dozen years
since that happened, but those two men, who are
among the hardest public workers of the day,
are as fresh and fit for their duties now as they
were then. And this, not from any natural
strength or stamina, but simply because they
have always taken pains to carry out the
fundamental laws of health.</p>

<p>The remainder of this book will be directed
to the consideration of these laws, on which
the whole question of breakdowns and their
prevention depends.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER <abbr title="6">VI.</abbr><br />
<span class="sub_head">THE HUMAN ENGINE AND HOW TO STOKE IT.</span></h2>

<p>An express train was standing in a London
terminus, on the point of starting for her run to
Edinburgh. Several persons were admiring the
great locomotive, which was throbbing like a
hound in leash, ready to be off the moment the
guard’s signal was given. The guard waved his
flag, and the train glided out of the station so
smoothly, that the unwary passenger standing up
in his compartment at the time was not even
jolted. The first stopping-place, a hundred miles
away, was reached on the stroke of time, without
a hitch of any sort.</p>

<p>The man who was responsible for this perfect
running was not the driver so much as the stoker,
that humble individual, as we are apt to regard
him, whose duty it was to put the coal on the
fires. Unless he had done his work efficiently, the
best driver of the finest locomotive ever built
could not have made a good run.</p>

<p>He took care to use the right sort of coal, to put
in enough of it to keep the fires bright, but not so
much as to choke them up, and to shovel it in with
discretion and at suitable times. Few people
realise that there is a distinct art in stoking a
furnace.</p>

<p>Yet that stoker was not a happy man. He was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
sallow and of a livery type. He often suffered from
headaches and spots before his eyes, heartburn
and nausea. Although he was muscular and
powerfully built, he frequently felt so tired and
listless that he was hardly able to face his day’s
work.</p>

<p>All this was due to the circumstance that,
although he had mastered the stoking of an engine,
he had never learned to feed himself properly.
He had not realised that he himself was an
engine, quite as much so as the locomotive he
worked on, and that the food he took was the
fuel which supplied the driving power to his
system and kept his machinery running. It
had never dawned on him that there is an art in
eating just as important as that of stoking, and
demanding as much care and foresight.</p>

<p>He would take his meals at any time that
happened to be convenient, and would eat
anything that came before him, regardless as to
whether it suited him or not. Furthermore, he
often ate to repletion, and bolted his food down
without masticating it properly. And that was
why his own machinery ran badly and he felt
tired and depressed. In which respects he was
exactly like thousands of other people.</p>

<p>This resemblance between a steam engine and
the human body is a pronounced one. As we
have already pointed out, the food, after being
digested and absorbed through the walls of the
digestive tract, is burnt up in the tissues by a
process closely corresponding to that of ordinary
combustion, and there is a residue of waste<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
products left behind resembling the cinders
and ashes of a coal fire. Nature is able in various
ways to dispose of this waste, eliminating it from
the body. If, however, the amount of food taken
be excessive, the residue is so large that the
resources of the system are not sufficient to cope
with it, and in consequence it accumulates in the
tissues.</p>

<p>Then the individual suffers from discomfort
or pains in the muscles, and from headache with
a sense of tiredness, even apart from exercise or
work; also from various other symptoms, owing
to this waste matter circulating in the blood.</p>

<p>The wrong sort of food may have been taken,
or eaten either too quickly or at unsuitable times,
and dyspepsia results. Then there is a certain
amount of undigested food constantly left behind
in the stomach, and this begins to ferment,
developing a poison of its own, which gets into the
circulation and aggravates the effect of that
already present. At the same time the nutritive
quality of the food is diminished, so that there is
superadded a process of starvation. There is
plenty of food, but little nourishment.</p>

<p>The final stage is therefore one of poisoning
and inanition combined. The effect of this on the
whole body, and especially on the nervous system,
is harmful to the last degree. The headaches are
accentuated, and the individual feels depressed
and irritable. The irritating influence of these
baneful products is so marked, that the different
organs begin to show signs of the damage which
is slowly but surely taking place, and the delicate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
nervous system feels the influence of it most of all.
The pain, discomfort and nausea caused by the
contact of acid undigested food with the lining of
the stomach add to the feeling of misery.</p>

<p>This may go on for years, until with one thing
and another life is hardly worth living. It may
disappear for a time, only to return, perhaps, in an
aggravated form. Meanwhile the strain on the
whole organisation becomes greater, as the organs
grow less capable of propping each other up. If
it is allowed to continue indefinitely, the time may
come when Nature will rebel, refusing to be treated
in this scurvy manner any longer.</p>

<p>The art of feeding resolves itself into four
considerations: the sort of food to take, the
amount necessary, how and when to eat it.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
</div>

<div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER <abbr title="7">VII.</abbr><br />
<span class="sub_head">WHAT TO EAT.</span></h2>

<p>Simple as this may appear at first sight, it is one
of the most difficult problems with which human
beings are confronted. The diet of a horse is
limited, so is that of fowls. Among wild animals
we find some that are flesh eaters, such as the
lion and the tiger, while others live on vegetables
or fruits. Man, on the other hand, like the pig
(save the mark!) eats everything, and the
question is what to choose out of this unlimited
bill of fare.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Differences
of
constitutions.</div>

<p>We must remember that people are not all built
alike, and that what is one man’s food is another’s
poison. There is no greater
mistake than that of imitating
other people. The native of India
thrives on rice, but white men
who attempt to live exclusively on
it soon find their systems going to pieces.</p>

<p>Even among persons of the same race we find
marked differences. One of our neighbours
flourishes on vegetables and bread; we adopt
the same diet, with the result that we become too
tired to do our work. Another takes meat three
times a day and looks well on it; we try the same,
and grow gouty. Another consumes a quart of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
milk a day in addition to his ordinary food, and
says he cannot get on without it; we follow his
example, and get a bilious attack.</p>

<p>There is a hale old gentleman of eighty who
takes every night a supper of bread and cheese,
with beer and walnuts to follow, going to bed
immediately afterwards, and waking up fresh and
vigorous in the morning. Most of us, if we took
a supper like that, would go to bed to stay there.</p>

<p>The fact is that there is no general rule
applicable to everyone. Some people thrive on
a vegetarian diet, but others cannot get along on
it at all; and the same remark applies to every
other such restriction. It rests with each
individual to discover for himself or herself what
foods suit them best and keep to them, avoiding
any which manifestly disagree.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Likes and
dislikes.</div>

<p>Within reasonable bounds the question of likes
and dislikes is a useful guide. Rich, highly-seasoned
dishes are of course bad
for everybody; but as applied to
plain, healthy articles of food, it is
safe to say that what people like
agrees with them, and <i>vice versa</i>.</p>

<p>As to dislikes, there are no two opinions on the
subject. If the taste of any food is repugnant it
should be avoided like poison. In fact, so far as
that particular person is concerned, it probably
is a poison. Some people dislike cheese to such
an extent that they cannot even swallow it, try
as they may. If they did succeed in getting it
down the results would most likely be disastrous.
I know of one family who cannot take eggs in any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
form, not even in the smallest quantity as a mere
flavouring. If they get it by mistake they are
ill with an attack resembling acute gastritis for
days afterwards.</p>

<p>It does not follow that a patient has been living
luxuriously because he is suffering from habitual
dyspepsia. It is not uncommon to hear people
say that they cannot understand why they should
be so afflicted, as their diet had been of the
plainest. Bacon and dry bread, with toast and
marmalade to follow, sounds rational enough in
all conscience. But if the bacon is badly fried
and swimming in fat, the bread new, and the
toast hot and soaked in butter, it is not surprising
that people feel wretched and uncomfortable for
the rest of the morning.</p>

<p>The way in which food is cooked has always to
be taken into consideration. Some cooks and
housewives have a genius for spoiling good food,
either in the way they prepare it or by their
neglect to clean the pots and pans. Greasy
saucepans have much to account for.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Classes of
food.</div>

<p>Sometimes, however, the fault lies at the door
of the person concerned. A partiality for new
bread, and an unwillingness to give
it up when so advised, have been at
the root of a chronic dyspepsia with
all its attendant evils. Articles of
diet are divided into four classes: Proteids or meat
foods, carbohydrates or starchy, oils and fats,
water and other liquids.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Meats.</div>

<p>Proteids or meat foods, include fish, fowl,
butcher’s meat, and vegetables, such as peas,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
beans and lentils. The problem of
meat, and particularly butcher’s
meat, is a vital one for all who are
getting on in years. So long as people have no
organic disease necessitating special diet they
cannot go far wrong in regard to fowl, fish,
tongue, ham or bacon. It is a different matter
when we come to deal with butcher’s meat, for
this contains a large proportion of fibre, which
constitutes one of the most difficult forms of waste
matter to get rid of.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Meat and
gout.</div>

<p>And the ill-effects of this waste matter are more
pronounced as people get older, for however
healthy they may be, their systems
become less capable of eliminating
it. It is an excellent rule, therefore,
for all persons approaching middle
age, even for those who have got into the forties,
to reduce their allowance of butcher’s meat,
especially beef, taking it no oftener than once a
day, and preferably at midday instead of in the
evening. Digestion goes on very slowly, if at
all, during the hours of sleep, and the habit of
eating meat at late dinner or supper is one of the
chief causes tending to gout and rheumatism of
the gouty type.</p>

<p>It is this disease in some phase or other which
is the starting-point of so many breakdowns in
health. The harmful residue in the system affects
almost every organ and tissue, and the arteries in
particular. Its most serious effect is on the
vessels of the kidney: when once they have
become thickened, the elimination of waste<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
matter is reduced to dangerous limits. Then the
health of the whole system is imperilled, for
one of the most important outlets has become
blocked up.</p>

<p>Too often this complication means the beginning
of the end, the onset of premature old age. It is
on this account, and not from any desire to
advocate vegetarianism, that I have emphasised
the necessity of diminishing the quantity of
butcher’s meat, once the period of early manhood
has gone past. In fact, it would be to the benefit
of all, young and old alike, to take nothing heavier
than fish or fowl at least one or two days a week.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Starchy
foods.</div>

<p>Carbohydrates or starchy foods. These include
bread, sago, tapioca, rice, and underground
vegetables such as potatoes. Bread
is the most important of these. It
is called the staff of life, and yet it
accounts for more dyspepsia than all
other causes put together, and for more miserableness
than all the incidental troubles and misfortunes
of life in one. For there is nothing
which depresses a man’s spirits so effectually as
dyspepsia, and an overwhelming proportion of
cases of this complaint are due to the imperfect
digestion of starchy foods, of which bread is the
most common.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
saliva.</div>

<p>Starchy foods are dealt with by the saliva, and
this, in order to do its work properly, must
penetrate to the heart of the
granules. And this it cannot do if
something else has got there first.
People are often surprised when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
they get indigestion after partaking of bread and
milk; that is, bread soaked in hot milk. But the
milk has permeated the starch granules, and as
two things cannot be in the same place at the
same time, the saliva cannot get there.</p>

<p>This explains why bread is the source of so
much discomfort. For bread, as it is usually
made in this country, is more or less moist, and
consequently the saliva has the same difficulty to
encounter as in the case of bread and milk. The
water has arrived first and keeps the saliva
out. If the process were carried on to a
further and drier stage, as in the hardbake of
the Colonial, we should be able to assimilate it
with ease.</p>

<p>We are apt to envy the Oriental his capacity
for digesting starch. Yet his powers in this
direction are due not so much to any inherited
faculty on his part as to the way in which the rice
is cooked. The glutinous material on the outside
of the granules prevents the saliva from penetrating.
The Oriental gets rid of it by washing
the rice in cold water half-way through the
cooking, rubbing it between his hands at the same
time. The writer once recommended this plan
to a lady who complained of indigestion after
eating rice, and told her that if she insisted on its
being carried out she would have no further
difficulty in the matter. She replied that there
would be a great difficulty&mdash;the cook would
immediately give notice.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The slow
poison of
dyspepsia.</div>

<p>Yet if these hints as to the preparation of
starchy foods were taken advantage of, we should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
hear much less of the fermentative
dyspepsia which is at the root of
so much of the slow poisoning from
which many people suffer, to the
detriment of their general health
and their nervous systems in particular.</p>

<p>It is this slow, long-continued poisoning which
undermines the nervous system and lays it open
to attack from all the other causes that predispose
to a breakdown. No amount of inconvenience
or self-denial is too great that can lead to the
avoidance of the dyspepsia which causes it. And
this ailment may accompany the plainest and
simplest of diets, if they are taken in the wrong
way. Space would not permit of our treating
this fully, but mention will be made of two or
three common articles of diet which are liable to
be followed by indigestion.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Eggs.</div>

<p>Apart from any special idiosyncrasy, many
people suffer from nausea or some other form of
discomfort after taking eggs. It is
not uncommon to hear people say
that they can take them in the latter
part of the day, but not in the mornings, without
some ill-effect. If that is so, they should be careful
to avoid having them for breakfast, for when taken
at this meal they are often responsible for headaches
which come on in the course of the morning.</p>

<p>In many cases these bad effects can be avoided
by having the eggs boiled for eight minutes.
This prolonged boiling reduces the contents to a
light powder, and seems to get rid of some
element that is of a poisonous nature.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Soup.</div>

<p>A small quantity of soup is beneficial as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
preliminary to dinner. If a man is tired after his
day’s work it stimulates the
digestion and puts it into a better
condition to do its work. On the
other hand, it is a great mistake to take too much
of it, as then it is apt to swamp the stomach with
so much liquid as to hinder the secretion of
gastric juice.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Fats and
oils.</div>

<p>Some people can digest fat who cannot take oil
without becoming bilious, and some cannot take
either. Yet it is as a rule the very
ones who cannot take one or the
other who try to do so, in spite of
their aversion for it. It seems
strange that it is stout people who are best able
to digest fat, and thin ones who cannot do so.
It is not so strange after all, however, for the
simple reason that people are thin because they
cannot assimilate fat.</p>

<p>Yet oftentimes we find such persons persevering
in taking fat or even cod-liver oil, in order to put
on flesh. The result is, in many instances, that
they become thinner than ever, owing to their
digestions being thrown completely out of order.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Milk.</div>

<p>Milk is the ideal food. Yet there is no food,
however ideal, which can be regarded as universal.
There are some people, and not a
few, who cannot take milk without
suffering from indigestion or biliousness.
Even among children one finds this
peculiarity at times; if such youngsters are
forced to drink it, they are upset in consequence.</p>

<p>This is often due to the fact that it is taken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
raw and undiluted. There is a widely prevalent
theory to the effect that any interference with the
milk in its natural state deprives it of its nutritive
qualities. This is not the case. If the milk is
boiled, for instance, a certain substance which it
contains, casein by name, undergoes a change.
Yet it is this casein which causes the curdling of
milk that is prone to take place in many stomachs,
producing flatulence, pain, and it may be actual
vomiting. This casein is nutritious to those
whose digestions can cope with it, but for those
who cannot digest it the boiling is of great
advantage, as the remaining elements of the milk
become more nutritious because more digestible.</p>

<p>It is of no use simply to heat the milk, it must
be actually brought to the boil. If the taste of
it in this form is objected to, this can be overcome
by adding a little sugar or salt, or a flavouring of
nutmeg. And if the patients do not care for it
hot, it may be cooled down and taken cold with
or without soda-water.</p>

<p>Sour milk, either in the form of ordinary
butter-milk or prepared in the scientific manner,
is one of the healthiest of drinks. It has been
a well-established fact for many years that
people living in parts of the country where the
drinking of butter-milk is in vogue are
exceptionally healthy. This led to the researches
which culminated in the sour milk treatment,
which came so much to the front a few years ago.
It was a valuable discovery, for many of us are
so situated that we cannot get butter-milk.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
Also, the scientific way of preparing it is much
cleaner and more satisfactory than the old crude
one, which was liable to implant other and less
desirable germs in our inside along with the
health-giving ones.</p>

<p>When this treatment came into vogue we were
all to lose our aches and pains, and enjoy robust
health or something approaching it. Already, in
this short time, the method has fallen almost into
disrepute. And simply, so people said, because
it did not do what it professed. In this they
did it a great injustice. If it did not do what
it professed to accomplish it was only because
it did not have a chance. If people continue to
eat all sorts of unsuitable things and bolt them
down, they need not expect to whitewash their
insides by taking sour milk on the top of an
injudicious diet. Like a good many other
adjuncts to health, it has to be taken with a grain,
not of salt but of sound common sense.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sauces.</div>

<p>People are often perplexed on the question of
sauces, as to whether they are harmful or otherwise.
A rich, oily sauce is only
too likely to cause dyspepsia, but
a flavouring of what we might term
a “clean” sauce is often an aid to digestion.
For in spite of all that has been said and written
on the subject of plain foods, there is no doubt
that if a taste is pleasant it tends to stimulate
the flow of saliva and gastric juice. There is a
scientific foundation for the saying, “It makes
my mouth water.”</p>

<p>The main disadvantages of sauces and spices<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
is that if used to excess they are apt to increase
the appetite more than they stimulate the gastric
juice, and so lead to more food being taken than
can be digested.</p>

<p>After all, hunger is the best sauce, and the man
who has earned his meal by work or exercise has
little need of artificial aids and flavourings.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Tea.</div>

<p>A vast amount of evil has been attributed
to the use of tea. To a certain extent this
condemnation is true. Yet it is
not so much the tea itself as the
way in which it is made and the
conditions under which it is taken that are to be
blamed for the mischief.</p>

<p>If allowed to stand stewing for long it is nothing
short of a poison. For then it is converted into a
concentrated extract of tannin, which has a most
irritating effect on the wall of the stomach,
producing a secretion of acid liquid, causing
heartburn and perhaps injuring the delicate
mucous membrane to the point of ulceration.</p>

<p>There is also another deleterious substance
present called thein, and this has a specially
pernicious influence on the nervous system when
taken in excess. If tea is drunk within a few
minutes of being made there is just enough of
this alkaloid to produce a pleasant, refreshing
effect without any harm being done. Yet even
when prepared in this way, but taken too frequently,
the accumulated effect of repeated small
doses is as injurious as a large one, causing
nervous irritability and sleeplessness.</p>

<p>In many instances the harm of tea-drinking lies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
in the fact of its being taken at wrong times.
The custom of drinking it after a meal such as
dinner is a bad one, as it retards the flow of
gastric juice.</p>

<p>Of all pernicious customs there is none more
to be deprecated than that of high tea, as it is
called. It is a sociable meal, but a deadly one.
Many of us look back with a shudder to an array
of sardines, tongue, ham or fish, followed by bread
and butter with two sorts of jam, buns and cakes
of all sorts, washed down with copious draughts
of strong tea.</p>

<p>The use of tea, as opposed to its abuse or misuse,
is highly beneficial to the system. There is no
remedy equal to it for a tired headache. It
washes out the stomach and gives it a fresh start
for the next meal. A cup of tea in the early
morning will often enable a better breakfast to
be taken, and one in the afternoon between four
and five o’clock helps to complete the digestion
of the midday meal.</p>

<p>Furthermore, it serves a good purpose in making
the blood circulate more freely and in dilating
the vessels of the skin, thus assisting in the
elimination of waste matter. In this respect it
is much better adapted than cold drinks in hot
weather, particularly for those engaged in active
outdoor games, such as tennis. For it makes a
more efficient thirst-quencher, and by flushing out
the tissues helps to prevent the onset of fatigue.</p>

<p>Have it freshly made, take it in moderation,
and it will never do any harm. Especially is this
the case with China tea, if taken in preference to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
Indian, for it does not injure the stomach or the
nerves in the way that the latter is apt to do.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Coffee.</div>

<p>Coffee does not as a rule tend to cause indigestion
or affect the nerves; its ill-effects are due to the
fact of its causing biliousness.
People of what is known as a
“livery” type had better avoid it
altogether, if they have found it to have this
result. Yet they might as well ascertain first as
to whether it was the coffee or the milk which they
took with it which accounted for their discomfort.
It is a mystery as to why people, who cannot on
their own assertion take hot milk without upsetting
their livers, should drink it when its taste
is disguised by that of coffee. The milk is there
just the same, and the after-effects are bound to
be as bad as if taken by itself.</p>

<p>Let such persons take their coffee thin, making
it with water, and adding only as much milk as
they would put into their tea, and it will probably
turn out that they can take it without any bad
after-effects.</p>

<p>There is one form, however, in which this
beverage is harmful. That is in the form of
black coffee. When taken in this form it certainly
causes indigestion as well as biliousness. Some
of the most persistent cases of dyspepsia,
especially that which is most pronounced on
waking up in the morning, are due entirely to
the habit of drinking black coffee after dinner
in the evenings. And the taste is evidently a
seductive one, for there is no habit, not even that
of alcohol, more difficult to eradicate. Yet until<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
the use of coffee in this form is given up, the
dyspepsia will most surely persist.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Water.</div>

<p>The amount of liquid consumed in the twenty-four
hours is one of the most important questions
in connection with diet, especially
for anyone suffering from headaches,
rheumatic pains, malaise,
undue fatigue, and a variety of suchlike complaints,
“minor ailments” as they are called.
These ailments are anything but minor, we may
observe, in regard to the amount of suffering
they cause, and the train of symptoms and
diseases to which they lead.</p>

<p>Without a sufficient quantity of liquids the
waste matter in the tissues is apt to become too
condensed, and on this account less able to reach
the eliminatory organs, whose function it is to
throw it off. It not uncommonly happens that
a man will consult a doctor, complaining that he
is suffering from pains in his limbs, either in the
muscles or the joints or both, also from a constant
dull headache and sense of tiredness. He fears
that he is on the verge of rheumatic fever, and it
is not improbable that that is exactly what he is.
On inquiry it turns out that he has been in the
habit of taking very little liquid either with
meals or between them. He is told to take an
extra quart, two if possible, a day. Then it often
happens that in a week or two all his symptoms
have disappeared, and he is capable of as much
exertion as he ever was.</p>

<p>The liquid may be taken in any form, hot or
cold, or in tea, coffee, lemon water or any other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
beverage the person may prefer. It does not
matter how it is taken, so long as it gets into the
system.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Alcohol.</div>

<p>So much has been written and spoken on the
subject of alcohol, that it would seem almost
unnecessary to discuss it fully here.
Ten or fifteen years ago the necessity
would have been vastly more
pressing than it is to-day. For no change is
more remarkable than that which has come over
public opinion on this topic of recent years. For
nearly a century temperance reformers have been
combating the moral effect of strong drink.
Then the medical aspect of the question came
to the fore, and the moderate drinker began to
wonder if the matter did not apply to himself as
well as to the drunkard.</p>

<p>Excess is a matter of personal equation, and
many men who have always considered themselves
strictly temperate have begun to realise
that while the amount they were taking was not
sufficient to affect their moral fibre, it was too
much so far as their bodily health was concerned.
Consequently a welcome improvement has been
manifest in the drinking habits of the community.
The growth of athletics has no doubt had much
to do with this change.</p>

<p>It may be, too, that the attitude of the medical
profession has had a share. Twenty or thirty
years ago it was a dangerous thing for a doctor
to tell a patient to reduce his ration of alcohol.
Now the profession gives its orders on the point
with as little hesitation as it exhibits in ordering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
a diet. And the public has shown its appreciation
of this fact in the view it has taken. Once a
doctor who did not order wine during convalescence
was looked upon as a faddist. Now
he is regarded as old-fashioned if he does so,
unless there is some special reason for it.</p>

<p>While reserving for every man the right of his
own opinions as to alcohol as a beverage, medical
men rarely order it save as a drug, as in the
administration of brandy in acute illness.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most significant proof of the
change in public opinion is the fact that many
patients now ask a doctor, not which form of
alcohol is “the best for them,” but which “will
do them the least harm.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER <abbr title="8">VIII.</abbr><br />
<span class="sub_head">HOW TO EAT FOOD.</span></h2>

<div class="sidenote">Mastication.</div>

<p>This is even more important than the nature of
the food itself. The great majority of digestive
troubles are due to the habit of
taking food too quickly, and
imperfectly masticating it. It is
surprising what people can eat with impunity
provided they take it slowly and chew it until
it is reduced to a fine pulp, almost a liquid in fact,
in the mouth. When staying at an hotel some
time ago I met a gentleman of seventy who told
me that he had never known all his life what it
was to have a pain or a discomfort in his stomach.
And his looks bore out his statement. Yet he
would take most things that were set before him,
but he ate them with a deliberation that is seldom
met with nowadays.</p>

<p>One has only to go into any restaurant to see
crowds of men eating their food like ostriches,
but without the digestion of an ostrich to deal
with it after it has been swallowed. The rush
and hurry of these days have caused meal-times
to be looked upon as necessary nuisances, an
unavoidable interference with the day’s work,
rather than as a vitally-important function, and
an opportunity for a congenial rest. Men get
into such a habit of hurrying when at their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
business, that they attack their meals in the same
manner, whether there be any need for haste or
not. And if the urgency of their work is such as
to curtail the time required for lunch or dinner,
it would do them far less harm and vastly more
good to take half the meal quietly instead of
bolting the whole lot. Every bite that is
swallowed without being masticated is a nail in
a man’s coffin. And as we have seen already, this
applies to soft foods as well as to those which are
of a more substantial nature.</p>

<p>When mastication is imperfect the starchy
foods do not get their meed of saliva, and when
meaty ones are taken in the same way, they are
swallowed in too solid a form to be acted on by
the gastric juices in the stomach. Indigestion
results, and this means that the eatables lose their
power of nourishment, and, what is even worse,
become tainted with poison. Then there is not
only trouble in the present, but even greater
trouble in the remote future, which, if it gets
beyond a certain stage, may baffle all the resources
of medicine to put it right.</p>

<p>Yet few people will acknowledge to this bad
habit. It is only when they are persuaded to
take special notice of their manner of eating that
they can be convinced of the fact. They resent
the imputation that they are eating incorrectly.
“We always live on plain, healthy food,” they
say. Quite so; but the healthiest food can
become a menace if taken in the wrong fashion.
They scoff at the people who go in for a number
of courses calling them gourmands. Yet many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
a man who takes a simple dinner, meat and
vegetables followed by pudding, actually takes
more than those who indulge in a greater variety
of courses, but much smaller ones.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Intervals
between
bites.</div>

<p>Strange to say, many people who often suffer
from indigestion after their simple fare at home
can go through an hotel menu
without any bad after-effects. It
is because the latter provides a
greater number of intervals. When
people are taking their two-course
dinner in their own homes they are eating all the
time, except for the interval between the meat
and the sweet course. The action of the stomach
is very much like that of a concertina. It needs
to contract and expand regularly, and if little
interval is allowed to elapse, it does not have the
chance of doing so.</p>

<p>This concertina motion also demands an interval
between the separate bites, and it gets it if the
diner has company, and is obliged to converse
during the meal. If it is eaten in silence, as
happens in the case of those condemned to live
alone, these intervals are lacking. In such a case
the only remedy is to be found in reading a book
or paper while taking the meal. It requires a
tremendous force of will for a man to eat carefully
and slowly when alone. He gets tired of the
sound of his own jaws. If he is occupied in
reading, he is much more likely to take his food
in a more leisurely manner.</p>

<p>There is no habit more difficult to eradicate
than this of rapid eating, and it needs constant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
care and attention, and we might add “practice,”
to get rid of it. The point is to avoid drinking
too much liquid with the meal, and never to drink
until the food has been swallowed. Otherwise it
is washed down before it is in a fit state.</p>

<p>It is many years since a well-known physician
advocated the custom of taking thirty-two bites
at each mouthful before swallowing it. He
probably selected this figure as representing the
total number of teeth in the adult jaws. Yet
twenty-two would probably do as well. It does
not follow that if this plan is adopted we shall
have to go on counting at each meal for the
remainder of our lives. The habit of mastication
would soon become so automatic that we should
not need to think about it at all.</p>

<p>Another point to keep in mind is to put down
the knife and fork or spoon between the separate
bites. This is of great importance, as it ensures
the requisite interval being obtained.</p>

<p>An excellent plan is to eat hard crusts without
taking any liquid. It is impossible to swallow
crusts until they are thoroughly masticated, at
any rate without suffering pain in the throat. A
little practice at this each day will soon inculcate
the habit of eating other kinds of food in a proper
manner.</p>

<p>In the case of children, and perhaps of adults
also, a good method is to insist on all food being
taken with a teaspoon. This will generally be
found efficacious.</p>

<p>Whatever method is adopted, nearly all cases
of dyspepsia, except those due to some disease<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
of the stomach, can be cured by this means
alone.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sound
teeth.</div>

<p>One essential, however, is the possession of
good, sound teeth. And no artificial teeth that
were ever made are equal to the
natural ones. Every effort should
be made, therefore, to keep the
latter as long as possible.</p>

<p>This can be done only by frequent brushing.
People sometimes ask whether they should brush
their teeth in the mornings or the evenings.
There is only one answer, “Both.” We might
also say, “And after each meal in addition.” It
is very little trouble, for it takes but half a minute
at the outside. And it is well worth doing this,
if it means that the teeth can be preserved.</p>

<p>There is nothing so good as a powder to clean
the teeth, the mechanical friction removes the
particles of food more efficiently than any liquid
or paste can do.</p>

<p>Of course, if the teeth are really bad they are
better taken out and supplanted by artificial
ones. Yet at the best these are like crutches
we must have them if we cannot walk without
their aid, but that is the most that can be said
for them.</p>

<p>Sound, healthy teeth are important for more
reasons than that of mastication. For if they
are allowed to get into a bad condition, a virulent
poison is developed in their sockets, which
destroys the virtues of the saliva, and also gets
down into the stomach, still further hindering
digestion. And its evil deeds do not end in this,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
for it is absorbed into the system, every part and
organ of which feels the effects of its baneful
influence.</p>

<p>It is only by constant and scrupulous care that
this disease, pyorrhœa by name, can be prevented
in the case of those whose teeth are in an unsatisfactory
condition. And if they have got to this
stage of decay, it is infinitely better to have them
all out. For it is not a disease which acts by fits
and starts. On the other hand, it is there, like
a lurking demon, working its subtle process of
pollution all the time, night and day alike. And
while it is better to have natural teeth than
artificial ones, the latter are vastly to be preferred
to a poison manufactory.</p>

<p>It is just because of the persistent way in which
this mischief acts that it forms one of the deadliest
foes against which the human body has to contend.
Its malign influence is so continuous and so all-pervading
that it becomes one of the most potent
factors in predisposing to breakdowns. No
sacrifice, either of time or money, is too great
that will help to prevent it or keep it in check.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER <abbr title="9">IX.</abbr><br />
<span class="sub_head">HOW MUCH FOOD TO TAKE.</span></h2>

<p>Speaking generally, the amount should be
sufficient to keep the body well and active, but
not to load it up with more than it can get rid
of.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Personal
requirements.</div>

<p>As to the actual amount, there is no guide save
that of personal requirements. Some people
need more than others, and without
any reference to the size of the
individual. A little man may easily
require twice as much as a big one.
It depends on the rate at which his
system burns it up. It is of no use, therefore, to
judge of our own needs by those of other people.
A noted big game hunter is said to be able to take
three full-course dinners in immediate succession,
without the slightest inconvenience or any
apparent detriment to his health. Such persons
can be regarded only as freaks, and any attempt
on the part of others to imitate their example
would lead to disaster. For we could no more
follow his lead in this respect than we could do
what he is also capable of, namely to go for three
days and nights without food or drink, and feel
no worse for so doing.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Appetite.</div>

<p>Appetite will usually be found a sound guide,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
provided that it is not satisfied to the point of
repletion. It is always well to eat
steadily and moderately, following
the time-worn plan of rising from
the table feeling as if you could eat more. Sometimes
a man will sit down as hungry as a hunter,
attacking his viands with avidity. Two hours
later he wishes that he had not. He has taken
more than his digestion can cope with, and the
result is that for a day or two afterwards he can
scarcely eat anything. If there is an excess of
appetite, so to speak, left over, it will keep until
the next meal. Regularity in amount, as well as
in times of feeding, is essential to health.</p>

<p>As a rule people eat too much, and need to be
reminded of the fact, tactfully of course. It is
astonishing to watch the improvement in health
and energy which often follows a reduction in
the amount of food taken. Many listless, tired
patients become bright and vigorous after they
have been persuaded to adopt this course. It is
not uncommon to see thin people who have been
overfed by their anxious relatives, and have
become sallow and dyspeptic in consequence.
In such cases it is difficult to convince the
individual himself, and still harder to convince
his friends, that he will not become thinner if he
takes less food. Yet practical experience has
shown that he not only fails to lose weight, but
in many cases even puts it on.</p>

<p>A physician once experimented with two men
of this type, pallid, seedy young fellows, both of
them. He kept them under his care for six<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
months, giving them one-third the amount of
food they had been accustomed to, and making
them take three times as long in eating it. By
the end of that period they had grown into
strong, lusty chaps, two stone in weight heavier,
and with a fine healthy colouring in their cheeks.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Excess of
food.</div>

<p>The average diet of the Anglo-Saxon is vastly
in excess of his needs. Especially does this refer
to the amount of food taken on Sundays. Why we should choose
to celebrate the Sabbath by eating
more and taking less exercise is a mystery. We often meet
with people who complain of feeling “Mondayish,” as they call
it. They think it is due to the reaction consequent
on resuming the week’s work, whereas it is nothing
more than the fact of their having eaten too much
on the previous day. For many people who are
abstemious enough during the week-days take
more at every meal on Sundays. They have
something extra for breakfast, and take it at a
later hour than usual; they have a hearty dinner
midday, and take cake and jam for tea, completing
the day by a hearty supper, in which cold meat
and pickles generally take a large share. And
all “because it is Sunday.”</p>

<p>Now if such persons can be prevailed upon to
make a light breakfast, eat moderately at dinner,
limit their food at tea to a biscuit or a piece of
bread and butter, and finish up with a rational
supper, they will find that on Monday mornings
they are as fresh as on any other day of the week;
in fact, probably much fresher. It would be a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
good thing for the community if people would
make Sunday a day of rest in regard to diet as
well as other things.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Diet at
middle age.</div>

<p>In speaking of butcher’s meat, we pointed out
that less of this is necessary in the case of people
approaching middle age. The
same remark applies, though not
with the same urgency perhaps, to
food of all sorts. As people grow
older the system loses some of its power of throwing
off the residue of waste matter, and it is of vital
importance, therefore, that people should exercise
even more care and discrimination than at any
previous period in their lives.</p>

<p>Yet as a rule they tend to eat more rather than
less. And the consequent strain upon the system
is the starting-point of many a breakdown. For
not only is the system less capable of eliminating
the waste, but the various organs have less power
to support each other when any of them suffer
in consequence of the extra effort demanded of
them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Diet for
the obese.</div>

<p>The question of a suitable diet for stout people
is one that bulks largely in the mind of the public
to-day. At one time the neurotic patient was always
supposed to be thin. It was the fat ones who kept
people alive and in a good humour.
It was all a myth, of course, and there was no
truth in it. It is all very well to talk about
“Laugh and grow fat,” but whether fat people
are addicted to laughing is another matter. For
gradually it began to dawn upon the world that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
they were rather a heavy, stolid set of folk
after all.</p>

<p>Then, to its surprise, it found that stout people
are more liable to neurasthenia than thin ones.
In any medical paper to-day you are almost
sure to see an article on neurasthenia and
obesity.</p>

<p>The result of all this has been that there are
more people wanting to get thin than thin people
desirous of getting stout. The question is how
they are to do it. It is generally supposed that
it can only be achieved by eating less. This is
quite correct in one way. They must eat less,
but of certain articles of diet. It does not follow
that they must always rise from the table craving
for food. It is a healthy custom, as we have
pointed out, for people to get up from the table
feeling that they could take more, but for some
to be doomed constantly to leave their meals as
hungry as when they sat down would be a hardship
that few would submit to.</p>

<p>Fortunately this is not necessary. It is not so
much the quantity of food as its quality which
accounts for putting on flesh. There are certain
articles which are fattening, not only because of
what they consist of in themselves, but also
because they tend to make other items give up
the fat they contain. The important point is to
avoid these foods. It must be made clear,
however, that a certain amount of laxity may be
allowed. There may be some of Falstaff’s
dimensions who may find it necessary to carry
out the diet to the letter. It may be a matter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
of urgency, perhaps of life itself, that they should
be brought down in weight, and without any loss
of time.</p>

<p>But there are others who feel that a certain
reduction is desirable, but not to the same degree
as these others. And such people, while following
the general principles, need not deny themselves
so completely as the stouter ones.</p>

<p>Speaking generally, the foods which tend to
put on weight are the starches, such as bread and
potatoes, sugars and fats. The following list
contains firstly those articles which have this
tendency, and then those which can be taken with
impunity.</p>

<p><em>Articles to be avoided.</em>&mdash;Cream and butter.
Bread, teacakes, scones and cake of all sorts.
Porridge. The fat of bacon, ham or any other
meat. Eggs. Red fish, as salmon and mullet.
Potatoes, turnips, carrots, parsnips, artichokes
and all other root vegetables. Puddings of all
kinds. Pastry, sweets, jellies, jam and sugar.
Apples, pears and bananas.</p>

<p><em>The following may be taken.</em>&mdash;Tea and coffee (but
not cocoa). Milk in strict moderation. Dry
biscuits, such as cracknel. Lean ham, bacon,
tongue, white fish, thin soup, fowl and game, and
the lean of butcher’s meat. Green vegetables,
cabbage, cauliflower, spinach, tomatoes, peas,
beans, asparagus. Cheese may be permitted in
small quantities.</p>

<p>Water should be taken apart from meals. If
taken hot before meals it has a reducing and
beneficial effect.</p>

<p>It will be seen from this list that there is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
no reason why anyone wishful to reduce their
weight need complain of a lack of food wherewith
to satisfy their appetites. Yet, if adhered
to, the diet rarely fails to bring about the
desired result.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER <abbr title="10">X.</abbr><br />
<span class="sub_head">WHEN TO TAKE FOOD.</span></h2>

<div class="sidenote">Punctuality.</div>

<p>Punctuality at meals is absolutely essential for
the maintenance of good health. The stomach
gets into the habit of secreting its
digestive juices at certain times, as
meals fall due. If it does not meet
with the food it has come to act upon, it will
seize upon the stomach wall and cause pain and
a nauseous sense of sinking. And these sensations
will probably be followed by a headache, for the
gastric juice, which is one of our vital agents, is
nothing less than an irritant poison if it has no
work to do. It is like a man loitering about an
office or workshop when trade is slack. He has
gone there to work, and when he finds nothing to
do except to hang around and put in time as best
he can, he becomes dissatisfied.</p>

<p>More than that, it is only too likely that if this
goes on for several days the man will fail to turn
up one morning. As there is nothing for him to
occupy his time with, he thinks he might as well
stay away. And that is exactly what the gastric
juice does under similar circumstances. If
people have been accustomed to take dinner at
one o’clock each day, and for several days in
succession turn up an hour late, they will find that
they begin to suffer from indigestion. The gastric<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
juice has got tired of making its appearance at
the proper time; as it has been treated with
contempt, it takes its revenge by staying away.
There is a form of gastric derangement known as
Commercial Traveller’s Dyspepsia, which is due
solely to the fact that with these members of the
community meal-times must be constantly varied,
owing to the exigencies of their work, and the
vagaries of railway trains.</p>

<p>Of course, it may be necessary at times to make
an alteration in a meal hour. When the light
summer evenings come, many people prefer to
change the hour of the evening meal, in order to
enjoy walks or outdoor games. If, however, the
new hour is adhered to, the stomach soon learns
to adapt itself to the change. It is the constant
chopping and changing about from day to day
that has such a pernicious effect on the system.</p>

<p>There is another member of the community
who is liable to suffer from the consequences of
irregularity in regard to the midday meal. It is
the woman whose husband cannot get home to
lunch, so that she is left to take it alone, unless
she has children to cater for. We confess to
having less sympathy for her than for the aforesaid
commercial traveller, for it is not the fault
of the latter that he does not get his meal regularly
at its proper time, while in the case of the woman
the blame lies entirely with herself. She takes
that deadly “something on a tray,” and takes it
at any time that suits her convenience. Probably
she has had a breakfast of tea and bread and
butter. Too often the same fare appears for her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
lunch. There is little wonder that often she is
a martyr to dyspepsia and headache.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Interval
between
meals.</div>

<p>The question as to the length of the interval
between meals is an important one. And here, in
particular, individual requirements
enter largely. Some people can go
for a considerable time without food
and feel better for so doing.
Others feel sick and unduly tired
if they fast too long. It rests with each one to
find out what suits them best.</p>

<p>On general principles, however, if an interval
is too short there is a likelihood of a certain
amount of food being left over still undigested
from the last meal. And this interferes with the
work of the stomach. Under such circumstances
the tongue is liable to be coated with a thick fur,
and the individual to suffer from a constant
feeling of nausea.</p>

<p>If, however, the interval is too long, the
system has become exhausted and the stomach
goes on strike. By the time the meal is taken,
the supply of gastric fluid has failed. If a long
interval between any two meals is unavoidable,
as for instance where a man has to have his
breakfast at eight and cannot get his lunch until
half-past one, it is better to take some light food
in the meantime. This prevents the sense of
exhaustion, and does not hinder the stomach
from doing its work when it is called upon.
Otherwise the man is apt to get a headache
before he gets his meal, and indigestion after he
has taken it.</p>

<p>This is a very different matter from the habit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
of eating between meals, whether it be in regard
to sweets or to heavier articles of diet. There
is a form of hunger known as “false.” It comes
on an hour or two after meals, and is due to the
irritation of undigested food in the stomach.
As it is often accompanied by a sensation of
sinking, people sometimes take some food, such
as beef-tea or strong soup, to keep themselves up,
as they term it. The result is confusion worse
confounded, and if the process is repeated too
frequently serious damage may be inflicted on
the digestive organs.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Diet and
breakdowns.</div>

<p>I have dealt at considerable length with this
question of diet, simply because it has such an
important bearing on the subject
of breakdowns. There is no single
path that leads to breakdowns, the
way thither is rather a tangled
maze of paths, along which people stumble
blindly until they suddenly find themselves at
an <i>impasse</i>. Yet the point at which they first
left the high road of health consists in most cases
of a mistake or series of mistakes in regard to
their food and the manner in which they take it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The old
style.</div>

<p>The digestive troubles of the present day are
very different from those of a century ago.
“The fine old English gentleman,
one of the olden style,” consumed
an enormous breakfast and a still
more enormous dinner, washing
down vast quantities of food with great draughts
of beer or wine. Every now and then he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
laid up with a stomach-ache or an attack of gout,
and for a day or two made the welkin ring with
his upbraidings; then he turned up again, as
fresh as any young buck, and went on his way rejoicing
until the next attack laid him by the heels.</p>

<p>We marvel that he survived to tell the tale.
“I should be dead in a week if I did such things,”
one of my readers probably remarks. Yes, but
the hale old chap led a different sort of life from
that which we lead to-day. He spent most of his
time in the saddle or in walking about the country-side.
Moreover, the food he ate was of such a solid
nature that he was bound to chew it well before
he could swallow it. And the bilious or gouty
attacks from which he suffered afforded a welcome
respite to the whole system, giving it the chance to
throw off a large amount of deleterious matter.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The present
style.</div>

<p>There is no comparison between such a
process as this and the continued remorseless
poisoning from which many people
suffer in these days as a result of
dietetic mistakes. And this poison
finds an easy victim in the constitutions
of to-day. These hearty blades of olden
times did not impose much strain on their nervous
systems. They lived nearer to Nature instead of
cooping themselves up in offices and businesses,
straining body and mind in the struggle to make
a livelihood or a fortune. All the more reason
why we should take infinitely more care in regard
to our diet nowadays than our ancestors did.</p>

<p>At a dinner party some years ago one of the
guests was a sallow, dyspeptic-looking individual,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
of a melancholy cast of countenance, and with
nerves written in large characters all over him.
In fact, the state of his nerves constituted the chief
part of his conversation, to the utter boredom
of the lady he had taken in to dinner.</p>

<p>It appeared that he was always tired and
depressed, and could not make out why it was.
He had taken tonics and gone for holidays to
various health resorts, but had gained not the
slightest benefit.</p>

<p>He might have obtained some glimmering of
the truth if he had placed a mirror in front of
him as he dined, or even if he had only stopped
to think. For he ate rapidly, almost ravenously,
of every course that was set before him, bolting
it down with scarcely any attempt at mastication,
which the present style of preparing food renders
only too easy. “He was bound to make a good
dinner,” he said, as his business was of such an
arduous and worrying nature that he rarely had
time to get any lunch. At the conclusion of the
meal he apologised for taking out of his pocket
a box of digestive tablets. He was forced to have
them, he explained, as he was a martyr to dyspepsia.</p>

<p>Yet ten years before this man had been a
strong, healthy athlete. Now he had become a
wreck, and his life was a burden to him. Not
only was he incapable of doing his work properly
or of enjoying his pleasures, but he lived in a
constant dread of a nervous breakdown. And
the probability is that unless he has reformed his
ways of eating that catastrophe has happened to
him ere this.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER <abbr title="11">XI.</abbr><br />
<span class="sub_head">FRESH AIR.</span></h2>

<p>The very title, “Fresh Air,” conjures up visions of
wide-spreading moorlands and foam-flecked seas,
of sunny dales and quiet trout-streams, of breezy
golf links and bracing mountain-tops; of all the
things, in fact, which we are going to revel in
when we go for our next holiday.</p>

<p>When we go for our next holiday! And what
is to happen in the meantime? For fresh air is a
daily, we might say an hourly, necessity, not a
yearly luxury. The combustion on which the
health so largely depends is always going on.
The bodily engine never ceases running from the
beginning to the end of life. Sometimes it is
more active than at others, but even during sleep
itself, though the muscles may be relaxed and
motionless, the heart is acting, and the lungs must
continue to do their work. The machinery of the
body is never still, the furnaces are never out.
Sometimes they are burning fiercely, at other
times with a gentle glow.</p>

<p>Yet no matter whether it is one or the other,
it is necessary that the processes of combustion
should be complete, and the purer the air that
reaches the lungs, and the more there is of it, the
more effectually will this end be attained.</p>

<p>Send a tired, seedy-looking man into the open<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
air for a whole day, and even if he only lies down
or lounges about the whole time, you may notice
the difference in his looks by the time evening
has come. His eyes will be brighter and his
complexion clearer, and the dragging sense of
heaviness in his limbs will have disappeared.
Instead of discomfort and nausea, he will have a
good, healthy appetite.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Fresh air
and the
nervous
system.</div>

<p>As for his nervous system, there will be no
comparison. There is no tonic in the whole world
for jaded nerves like an abundant
supply of pure, fresh air. And if
sunshine can be obtained at the
same time so much the better, for
the effect of direct sunlight on the
body is simply remarkable. Some
years ago a new form of holiday was started in
the shape of trips to the Sahara, for the benefit
of those suffering from brain-fag. The success
which attended them was due largely to the free
supply of sunshine, not merely to the fact of the
patients being away from their work and ordinary
surroundings. Many of them had tried rest cures
elsewhere without any good result. It was only
when they spent weeks in some oasis, with the
sunlight pouring down on them from morning till
night, that their nervous systems recovered
themselves.</p>

<p>Yet these people should never have had brain-fag
if they had only carried out the rules we are
about to lay down.</p>

<p>Most of us are not in a position to go to the
Sahara, but we can get at home, if not such a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
flood of sunshine, at any rate enough fresh air,
in conjunction with other precautions as to diet
and so forth, to prevent our systems ever getting
into such a state as to make a trip of this sort,
with its outlay of time and money, a necessity.</p>

<p>Apart from sunshine, fresh air has a potent
influence on health. We all pine for fine holidays,
and no doubt they do us more good, in addition
to being more enjoyable, than wet ones. Yet it
is amazing how much better people look after
even a rainy holiday at the seaside or country.
The rest from the worries of business and so forth
has something to do with it, but I firmly believe
that half the benefit is due to the fact that when
people are on a holiday they spend the greater
part of their time in the open air.</p>

<p>A friend once remarked to me that he always
began to feel nervous and worried as soon as he
got back home. He wondered if the district
agreed with him. I asked him what sort of life
he led when he was in the country. And he
replied that he pottered about outside all the
time. If it was wet, he put on a mackintosh and
went out just the same. Yet he owned up that
he never thought of doing such a thing at home.</p>

<p>Two men were walking down a street in the
West of London on a winter’s afternoon. The
one was plodding along wearily with his eyes fixed
on the pavement and lines of care on his face.
The other held himself erect, walking with easy
strides, and looking around with genial eyes that
seemed to find an interest in everything they saw.
His breezy manner and the glow of health in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
cheeks were a marked contrast to the look of
weariness and pallor on the face of his companion.</p>

<p>Yet these two were brothers, brought up in the
same way and under the same conditions. The
one had applied himself to the law, finally settling
down in London, amazed that his brother should
be content to bury himself in the heart of the
country.</p>

<p>A few hours later they sat down to dinner
together, and the lawyer looked with envy at the
hearty way in which the country brother ate his
food, and the relish with which he seemed able to
take anything that was set before him. His own
appetite was fickle to the last degree, and even
when he ate any of the courses it was with a
doleful presentiment as to the effect they would
have upon him.</p>

<p>It was after midnight before the lawyer could
make up his mind to go to bed, and he went with
the expectation of a restless night. By that time
the other brother was enjoying a deep, untroubled
slumber.</p>

<p>Six months later you might have seen those
two men again walking side by side. This time
it was on an August morning amongst the fields
and hedgerows. The difference between them
was not so marked on this occasion. The lawyer
held his head higher, his eyes were brighter, and
his cheeks had lost much of their pallor. He did
not look down at the ground either, but gazed all
around him, and some of the careworn lines had
disappeared from his face. He had had three
weeks of pure, country air, and had spent most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
of it in the open. He was dreading the time, a
few days hence, when he would have to return to
town.</p>

<p>That was not anything out of the common.
We have all seen people returning from their
holidays looking like that. The surprising part&mdash;surprising
even to the man himself&mdash;was to
follow. For during the following winter you
might have watched that lawyer stepping out of
his office any afternoon, and would have been
amazed to notice that he had never lost the
improvement which he had gained during his
weeks in the country. His dread that he would
sink back into the same nervous, dyspeptic state
as before had been unfounded.</p>

<p>For it was only a few days after he had got
back to town that he had been talking to a friend
and telling him how much better he had felt after
his open-air holiday. And the friend had said,
“Then why not keep it up now you are at home?”</p>

<p>That remark had set the lawyer thinking, and
the force of it had impressed him deeply. So
instead of driving to his office each day he had
made a habit of covering the three miles on foot,
and returning home in the evening in the same
way. He had taken every opportunity of having
a walk, either along the streets or in the park,
and had felt a new man after it. And it was
not only his bodily health which had benefited;
his nervousness had gone, and he had ceased
to worry over his work and all his other affairs.
He had found not only fresh air during these
walks, but a vast number of other things to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
interest him at the same time. And the weather
did not seem of nearly the same importance as
before. If it was wet, he took a coat and umbrella
and trudged through it as contentedly as if he
were enjoying bright sunshine. To his surprise,
he did not catch cold nearly so often as he had
been accustomed to do.</p>

<p>Now this man only did what anyone else can
do, that is to secure a daily supply of fresh air.
There are vast numbers of people who would be
different creatures if they would have a walk
morning and evening, either before breakfast or
their evening meal, or on their way to and from
their work.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Fresh air
in the
home.</div>

<p>It is of little use, however, to take walks in the
fresh air if we come back to badly-ventilated
houses. There are some dwellings
in which the air always feels dead;
there is a staleness about it which
offends our nostrils the moment we
cross the threshold. The doors and
windows are kept closed, and the whole house reeks
of the accumulated poison from the lungs of
those who have lived beneath its roof.</p>

<p>In a north country dale there is a charming
cottage, its latticed windows framed in creepers,
standing back from the village street. It is the
admiration of all beholders, yet its beauty is
only the shell that hides a grim tragedy. There
were five children in the family, and one by one
they died of consumption. And if you examine
the pretty latticed windows more closely, you
will find the secret of their fell disorder, for not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
one of those windows, upstairs or down, will open.
Those youngsters played in the fresh air, they
went to school and returned home in it, but every
minute that they spent in the house they were
living in a poisoned atmosphere. If there had
been no such thing as bedtime, they might have
escaped; but it was no wonder that when some
tubercle bacilli made their way into that house
they found easy victims in the innocent, sleeping
forms of those children. For even the fireplace
in the bedroom was blocked up with a sack of
shavings.</p>

<p>An atmosphere of that sort is like a two-edged
sword, it cuts both ways. It not only lowers the
resisting power of the human body, but also
favours the growth of germs. And consumption
is not the only complaint to which vitiated air
may lead. There are many other forms of
ailments which, if not so deadly as this disease,
exercise a most pernicious influence on health.</p>

<p>Common colds play a far greater havoc with
the health of a nation than is usually supposed.
For it is not merely the loss of time spent in
getting rid of them, but the infinitely more
important fact that these chills and catarrhs
upset digestion, lower the general health, and lay
it open for deadlier enemies to enter. Sometimes
colds are of the influenza nature, the result of a
germ, which may fix itself in the throat in spite
of all precautions. Yet the influenza bacillus
itself finds the greatest ally in any catarrh of the
nose or throat. We frequently hear people say
that they had an ordinary cold which developed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
into influenza. It is a perfectly true statement,
and if the ordinary cold had not been there first,
it is more than probable that the influenza germ
would not have had a chance of establishing itself.</p>

<p>Nothing causes chills more than hot, stuffy
rooms. We often hear people complaining that
they took cold when they came out into the night
air. Yet it was not the night air which did the
mischief, but the poisonous atmosphere in the
room itself, due to the accumulated exhalations
of many lungs, etc. Had the apartment been
well ventilated the so-called chill would never
have occurred.</p>

<p>Most cases of asthma are the result of a bad
atmosphere. The catarrh has extended down
from the nose and throat into the bronchial tubes,
and set up a spasm which is the source of this
distressing malady. No asthmatic can afford to
keep his windows closed. Whether by day or
night, he needs a liberal supply of fresh air.</p>

<p>It is not so much by day that people suffer from
the effects of poor ventilating. For then most
of us are compelled by the force of circumstances
and the exigencies of our work to move about
from one place to another, even if it is only from
room to room. It is in the evenings, and winter
evenings in particular, that the atmosphere of the
dwelling-rooms becomes contaminated. The
family sits by the fireside, with the windows and
door closed, and they never notice how stuffy
and close the room is becoming, until someone
comes in from the outside air and beseeches them
to open the window.</p>

<p>Yet they go on sitting in that poisoned air,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
and one or two of them become drowsy and sit
half asleep, with the result that when bedtime
comes they have to face a restless night. Others,
perhaps, find their heads aching, and attribute
it to the fact they are working too hard during
the day.</p>

<p>But it is only when they go to bed in rooms
with the windows closed that the chief harm
comes. Considering what a large proportion of
our lives we spend in our bedrooms, it is of vital
importance that the air should be, if anything,
purer than that of the rooms we live in by
day. For at night we are not moving about, but
lying still, and the air does not get a chance of
renewing itself unless the ventilation is efficient.
Many people complain that they can scarcely
wake up in the mornings, they feel so heavy.
Or that when they do rouse themselves they have
a headache, which it takes hours to get rid of.
All this might be avoided by the use of the open
window.</p>

<p>The objection to it generally consists in the
fact that it makes a draught. There is no necessity
for this, however. There are some cranks who
have much to account for in regard to this matter.
They boast that they can sleep close to a window
which is open top and bottom to its fullest extent,
and are proud to say that they have waked up
in the morning to find that the rain had been
coming in and had soaked the bedclothes through
and through.</p>

<p>There may be a few constitutions which can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
stand this, but they are certainly in a hopeless
minority. The majority of people would find
themselves in “Queer Street” if they attempted
such folly, for folly it is without a doubt. In
one case where a father adopted vigorous methods
of this sort with his children it ended in one of
them getting an inflammation of the ear, which
resulted in incurable deafness.</p>

<p>There is reason in all things, ventilation
included. And fresh air can be secured without
any draught at all. A few inches top and bottom,
or only at the top if the weather be very stormy,
makes all the difference, either in a sitting-room
or a bedroom. Better still is the plan of fixing
a block of wood the width of the window frame
below the lower sash. That leaves a space
between the upper and lower sashes, which
ensures a constant supply of fresh air. If this be
adopted the atmosphere will always be pure and
healthy, even if the window is never opened any
farther.</p>

<p>It is vastly better to have this constant supply
of pure air in small doses than to throw the
window open wide after the atmosphere has
become hot and unpleasant.</p>

<p>Sometimes, however, it happens that in spite
of all our efforts we have to breathe air containing
some deleterious matter, germs or dust or what
ever else it may be. To meet this contingency,
Nature has provided a filter of her own. It
consists of a network inside the nostrils. That is
why it is of such importance to breathe through
the nose instead of the mouth. If all children<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
were taught to do this there would be fewer
colds and fevers. The nostrils would arrest the
unwholesome particles before they had a chance
of reaching the tonsils, which are such a suitable
soil for their growth.</p>

<p>Needless to say, pure air is of greater value when
it is inhaled as freely as possible. In order to
bring this about, it is necessary to breathe deeply.
There are not many people who get the best
value out of their lungs. As a rule, respiration is
much too light. In order to remedy this defect,
breathing exercises are of great value. The way
to carry them out is to stand with the hands on
the hips and breathe slowly in and out, inwardly
counting four each time in a deliberate manner,
and expanding the chest to its fullest possible
extent.</p>

<p>The mistake usually made is to lift the chest
with each inspiration. This only raises it, it
does not expand it. The proper way is to breathe
from the abdomen and lower part of the chest
wall. When this is done every part of the lung
is filled with air, and this has the great advantage
of preventing the air inside the lung spaces from
stagnating in any one part, an occurrence which
is always prone to lead to the onset of congestion
or disease.</p>

<p>It does another good turn too, for it inculcates
the habit of deep, full breathing. Those who
practise for a few minutes each day will soon find
themselves expanding their lungs habitually, even
when they are not thinking about it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Cleanliness
in the
house.</div>

<p>Yet even if windows and doors are kept open,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
something more is requisite. For unless a house
is scrupulously clean and the rooms
regularly turned out, it cannot be
healthy. If a piece of machinery
is left untouched for some months
it will never be as good as it was
before. The grease has become foul, whilst dust
and dirt have accumulated, and these insidious
elements have combined to destroy the quality
of the metal. That means that some time or
other some bar or joint or nut will crack, and
once that has happened the mischief rarely stops
there, but goes on to the weakening of other parts
and the deterioration of the whole machine.</p>

<p>And when human beings live in houses that are
not fresh and wholesome they are constantly
inhaling dust and fusty smells, which act as a
slow, subtle poison and lower the vitality of the
various tissues of the body. It is so gradual that
they may not notice it, until at last something
gives way, and after that the downward tendency
becomes comparatively rapid. When the cataclysm
occurs, they date it from the day when the
first crack, if we may call it so, appeared. Rather
should they look back to the long years spent in
an unhealthy atmosphere within their own homes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Hygiene in
the home.</div>

<p>There is no fault, however apparently trivial
it may seem, in matters of hygiene which does
not add its quota towards the final
breakdown of the human machinery.
The faulty, leaking gaspipe which
causes oft-repeated morning headaches;
the choked-up scullery sink, with its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
abominable mixture of soap, grease and vegetable
washings; the defective drain and pipes; each
and all do their evil part in undermining the
constitution and rendering it more prone to the
onset of disease.</p>

<p>There is another aspect of this question to
which too little prominence has been given. It
is that of tidiness, and its effect on the nervous
system. We all know that a tidy desk indicates
a methodical, well-regulated mind, and that one
which is in a litter is usually the sign of a man
whose ideas are confused and jumbled up.
Everyone does not realise that the sight of a
disorderly room, with waste paper lying on the
floor and an unswept hearth, has an irritating
effect on the nerves of a man or woman who comes
home jaded and tired.</p>

<p>We shall have occasion shortly to point out
that it is this harassed state which is one of the
most potent factors in causing nervous breakdowns.
And it is just when the home-comer
needs to have everything as smooth as possible
to put him or her into a calm and equable frame
of mind that their fretted nervous systems are
still further irritated by signs of disorder in their
homes. Tidiness is more than a mere virtue, it
is an indispensable adjunct to health.</p>

<p>All who wish to be well, and feel well, and
keep well, must seek a free and constant supply of
air, and strive to obtain it in all its freshness and
purity. They must secure it at all times too, at
home and away, indoors and out, summer and
winter, day and night. If everyone were to do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
this, the effect on the health and welfare of the
nation would be incalculable. They will find it
no irksome duty, for before long they will acquire
a taste, a longing, we might say a craving for it
which will make them wonder how they ever
managed to live without it.</p>

<p>An appetite for fresh air is one of those propensities
we can indulge in without any fear of
going to excess. We can revel in it, gourmandise
on it, smack our lips over it, and the more we get
of it the better we shall be.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER <abbr title="12">XII.</abbr><br />
<span class="sub_head">EXERCISE.</span></h2>

<p>Several men were riding home together in a
tramcar on their way from business, and were
discussing their health, as so many people do
nowadays. They were all looking tired and
depressed, and on comparing notes found that
they were all suffering from the same complaint,
“nervous exhaustion due to overwork.” At
least, that is what they called it. They were
tired when they went to bed, and just as tired
when they got up in the morning, and had no
energy for their day’s work. Why the latter
should have proved too much for them was a
mystery, as their hours were not long by any
means, and they were all in the prime of life.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, they were not suffering from
nervous exhaustion at all, but from poisoning,
the result of a sedentary occupation and want of
exercise. These men had an excess of waste
products in their system, retarding their digestions
and clogging their energies.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Exercise at
middle age.</div>

<p>It is particularly at or just before middle age
that the want of exercise so frequently manifests
itself. Most people keep up their
games or their walking until the
age of thirty or forty. It is after
that stage that they tend to settle
down and take things easily. If they would only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
reduce their diet at the same time little harm
might accrue, but unfortunately in many instances,
as we have already pointed out, they begin to eat
more instead of less. The result is that we are
confronted with the problem of increased intake
and diminished output. We often see men of
strong physique who have given up games and
reduced their walking to a minimum, and have
become moody and irritable, sleepless and
depressed.</p>

<p>This is because their systems have become
loaded with a superfluity of waste matter. And
the latter not only makes them headachy and
tired, but if the accumulation is allowed to go
on unchecked, it deranges the vital organs, the
kidneys particularly, and before long may actually
set up organic disease. After that the strain on
the whole bodily functions becomes greater and
greater, until the breaking-point is reached.
For as people grow older their organs have less
power of throwing off waste material, and become
less able to support one another when any weakness
appears.</p>

<p>These breakdowns are the most liable to occur
in the case of athletes who have been accustomed
to severe and active exercise all their lives. In
them the system seems to have learned to depend,
even more than in the case of other people, upon
hard exercise to keep it in good condition. And
when men of this type drop it too suddenly, the
results are disastrous. Yet that is what so many
of them tend to do. They are unable any longer
to indulge in the violent games and training to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
which they have been accustomed, and they will
not “lower themselves,” as I have heard it expressed,
to take part in milder forms of recreation.
Sometimes they even become too lazy to walk.</p>

<p>Of course, no man can be expected to keep up
his running, or take part in boat races, or practise
putting the weight after he has passed a certain
age. Nor would it be good for him to do so.
Once he has passed thirty he must begin to take
things a bit more slowly, and avoid taking part
in athletic contests. For racing in any form
involves a mental as well as a physical strain,
and few men beyond that age can stand the stress
of the two combined.</p>

<p>Yet if he cannot race he can still row or run or
whatever else it may be. Later on he may have
to give these up also, and take to quieter forms of
exercise. The secret lies in the gradual dropping
off. And no man need complain, for there are
plenty of outdoor games suited to every age and
every constitution.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Value of
exercise.</div>

<p>The great point is that everyone, men and
women alike, must have exercise of some kind or
other. For most of the vital
of processes of the body depend upon
it. It is the chief agent in burning
up the waste matter in the system,
reducing it to such a form as is most easily
excreted by the different organs. It also keeps
this waste on the move, and so brings it more
freely into contact with those organs. Furthermore,
it stimulates the action of the heart and
lungs, and so invigorates the circulation, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
supplies the respiratory tract with a more liberal
allowance of oxygen.</p>

<p>Then, freed from the incubus of the presence
of this poisonous matter, the digestion improves,
and the nervous system regains its wonted vigour
once more.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Regularity.</div>

<p>To be efficient, exercise must be steady and
regular. A long tramp or a violent burst of
tennis or some other game once a
week can never make up for days
of comparative inaction. More
than that, it is almost dangerous. The waste
products have meanwhile accumulated to such an
extent that, if they are suddenly stirred up, they
are apt to produce a severe headache or a bilious
attack. People are often puzzled and discouraged
when after a long walk on a Saturday afternoon
they feel so done up as to be unfit for anything for
the next twenty hours.</p>

<p>The exercise should be daily, so that the waste
matter is eliminated regularly. To realise the
difference between this method and the one we
have just been discussing, notice the effect of
dusting a room once a week compared with doing it
each day. It is the difference between an almost
imperceptible quantity of dust and a cloud that
fills the room and threatens to choke you.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Violent
exercise and
cramp.</div>

<p>There is one result of irregular exercise that
needs to be referred to here. It is cramp. This
painful complaint is due to a
deposit of waste matter in some
muscle, which it causes to contract
violently owing to the local irritation
set up. It is liable to occur<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
after hard or prolonged exercise of any sort,
especially in those who only take it now and then.
Sometimes, however, it is found in those who
never take part in games, as in elderly people, for
instance. In this case it is often due to the
habit of walking beyond the ordinary pace.
There are some temperaments which never allow
their possessors to walk quietly, even though age
or some infirmity demands it, and such persons
are very liable to wake up at night suffering
from cramp.</p>

<p>The treatment is to avoid too violent exercise
or to walk in a more leisurely fashion, as the case
may be. When it has come on, the remedy is to
rub the affected part vigorously, or put it into hot
water if such is available.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Outdoor
exercise.</div>

<p>Exercise, like all other indispensable things in
this world, needs to be carried out with discretion.
Because a lusty young fellow of
twenty finds that a hard game, such
as football, once a week, in addition
to steady daily exercise, suits him,
it does not follow that it is going to be of benefit
for a man of forty. It is an important point in
selecting a game to choose a suitable one. Golf
is often advocated as the ideal recreation for
middle-aged men. Yet one has known of cases
where a round of golf left a man jaded and tired,
but a game of bowls or tennis did him a world
of good. The one might require as much as the
other, but for some unknown reason it was better
adapted to the needs of the individual in question.
At the risk of offending every golfer in the country<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>&mdash;and
that is about every other man you meet&mdash;I
have no hesitation in saying that even if a man
does not play it he may be “a man for a’ that.”
And if it only worries and tires, instead of refreshing
him, he is vastly better advised to leave it
off, and take to something that suits him better
and is more in accordance with his feelings.</p>

<p>Half an hour a day spent in walking, cycling
or playing some outdoor game is sufficient to
keep the whole system in good working order.</p>

<p>Games have the advantage of adding the
stimulus of competition and complete change of
thought, but there is no better exercise than that
of walking. And after all the change of thought
can be obtained equally well at the same time,
if people have some outdoor hobby, as botany
or natural history. It also provides change of
scene, which is a fine mental tonic in itself.</p>

<p>The ideal form of recreation is to cycle to some
spot, leave your machine there, and set out for a
walk. By such means you get far away from
your ordinary surroundings, and also receive the
benefit of the pure air of the meadow or the
mountain-top.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
pavement
walk.</div>

<p>There are many people, however, who live in
towns, and, in winter especially, cannot reach
green fields or hills except when on
a holiday. There are wet days too
on which a country walk is hardly
possible or even desirable, on
account of the state of the roads.
Yet there is another form of walking which is of
great value under such circumstances. It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
what we may term the “pavement tramp.” An
hour’s brisk walk of this sort is an invaluable
boon to town-dwellers on a dull day or a wintry
night, when circumstances stand in the way of
any other form of exercise.</p>

<p>At times even the state of the pavements, as in
snowy weather, may render this impossible. In
that case, if you are feeling stale and unprofitable,
and longing for some active exercise, you may
obtain it by walking briskly up and down the
stairs. The servants will think you have gone
mad, but as they probably think that already,
this fact need not deter you from this form of
invigoration.</p>

<div class="sidenote">On starting
exercise.</div>

<p>When people who have previously neglected
exercise start to take it, they are often met with
one difficulty. They complain that
after they have walked for a mile
or so they are too tired to go any
farther, and when they return
home they do not feel refreshed but rather the
opposite. Under these circumstances we need
not hesitate to assure them that if they will but
persevere, this feeling of fatigue will pass off,
and a sense of enjoyment and lightness take its
place. Once they have experienced the truth of
this they are ready to continue the daily walk
and exercises, and soon begin to wonder how
they ever managed to live without them.</p>

<p>This acute fatigue is due to the stirring up of
the waste matter in the system. If, however,
they force themselves to keep on walking quietly,
the exercise itself will help to eliminate these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
undesirable elements, and so fulfil its most
important function.</p>

<p>This question of exercise calls for special
mention in the case of women of the middle and
upper classes. Too often their exercise for the
day consists in shopping or paying calls, neither
of which are conducive to health. The constantly
recurring headaches from which many women
of this type suffer might be cured, along with the
observance of the other rules of health, by the
observance of a daily walk and gentle exercises
within their own homes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Indoor
exercise.</div>

<p>Indoor exercise is the department in which so
many people go wrong. A young man is convinced
of the necessity of keeping
himself fit, and the way in which
as a rule he sets about it is to
practise with a pair of heavy
dumb-bells before breakfast, or else to buy a
developer and use it, for the purpose of getting
his muscles up.</p>

<p>Now Mr. Sandow himself has always been the
first to warn people against the abuse or over-use
of the developer, and against practising with
heavy dumb-bells. I was once amazed to hear
that great authority say that he could keep his
muscles in perfect condition with two-pound
dumb-bells. Little wonder, therefore, that men
of ordinary physique find themselves, after a
quarter of an hour with seven-pound ones, stale
and tired for the remainder of the day.</p>

<p>We have to bear in mind that the most
important muscle in the body is the heart.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
Cases are not uncommon in which young fellows
have developed their limb-muscles at the expense
of this vital organ, with the result that they have
been more or less incapacitated ever afterwards.
It may be very delightful to possess a biceps
twice as large as your neighbour’s, but beyond
the gratification of contracting it for their approval
there is nothing to be gained, unless you are
going to be a navvy, that is to say. And that is
not likely to be the case with any of my readers,
for navvies are not in the habit of perusing books
on health. They do not need to do so.</p>

<p>If a man needs certain muscles specially strong
for his work, his work will develop them for him.
Otherwise they are of little use to him, and he had
better conduct his exercises on a sounder principle.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Object of
exercise.</div>

<p>The main object of physical exercise is to keep
the whole body fit. In choosing suitable ones,
therefore, it is necessary to select
those which call upon all the
muscles of the body without any
undue strain upon any particular
set. If any one group is over-used there will
come a time when they will begin to waste away.
It is well known that in certain occupations
which throw great strain upon any one part,
such as the arms in the case of porters, who have
to be lifting heavy loads constantly, the muscles
of these regions enlarge enormously at first, but
often degenerate after a time, until at last the
limbs in question may be reduced almost to skin
and bone.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Swedish
exercises.</div>

<p>The best form of exercises for purposes of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
general health are those known as Swedish. No
dumb-bells are required, though
many people find it easier to
practise them if they have a piece
of wood in each hand. The
number of systems included in this category is
legion, and people are often perplexed to know
which one to choose. Some friend recommends
one set, then another comes along and says that
he has derived great benefit from a different set,
and a third strongly advocates some other. The
fact is there is no advantage in any one over the
rest. All are equally efficacious; the great point
is to do exercises of some sort. You can easily
plan out a set of your own, which will do quite
as well as any other.</p>

<p>Whichever are chosen, it is well to do them
gently at first, and for a short time only, gradually
increasing them as you become more accustomed
to the movements.</p>

<p>A good selection to start with is as follows.
Stretch out the arms in front, with the finger-tips
touching those of the opposite hand. Swing them
slowly backwards as far as they will go. Stretch
them out again in the same way, and try to touch
the toes, keeping the knees straight. Place the
hands on the waist and bend the body forwards
as far as possible and also from side to side. Lie
on the floor and raise the body without the aid of
the hands and with the knees stiff. Stand erect and
raise one leg slowly, balancing on the other foot.</p>

<p>A few simple exercises such as these are quite
sufficient to keep the whole system in good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
order. Complicated or difficult ones are never
necessary. The one great point, more important
than all else, is to attend carefully to the breathing
while making the movements. Take deep, slow
breaths, expanding the chest fully and exhale
slowly, always breathing through the nose. If you
get out of breath you are either doing the exercises
wrongly or breathing in an incorrect manner.</p>

<p>In addition to the above, you can devise fresh
ones as you go along. A good plan is to take
each joint in turn, and exercise it. Thus, start
with the fingers, clasping and unclasping the
hand. Then clench the fist and move the wrist
up and down. Do the same with the elbow and
shoulder, and with the different joints of the lower
extremities. Then bend the body backwards and
forwards, and the head in the same way. After
all that, there will be few muscles in the whole
body that have not received their due attention.</p>

<p>The value and the enjoyment of these exercises
can be increased very much by getting other
people to join you in them. It is easier to
persevere with anything if we have the society
of others to encourage us. There is a spirit of
emulation introduced which is always conducive
to success.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Imitation of
games.</div>

<p>If you are so fortunate as to have an empty
room or shed, there is nothing better than to
practise an imitation of some outdoor
game, such as playing tennis
against a wall. There is a zest
about such exercises which makes
them more profitable than those which are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
carried on merely from a sense of duty. One of
the finest forms of exercise is that of skipping,
both for men and women. The former need not
look upon it as a feminine pursuit, seeing that
some of the best-known athletes and boxers
employ it as a means of training.</p>

<p>It is simply astonishing what a difference
exercise, either outdoor or indoor, makes to those
who carry it out systematically. After a few
weeks pale, languid people begin to acquire a
healthy colour and a sense of vigour they have
never known for years; dyspeptic ones may forget
that they ever had a stomach; whilst headaches
that have been a curse for years are sometimes
seen to disappear like magic. Life becomes
brighter, for health and happiness go together,
and the whole outlook becomes more cheering.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Massage.</div>

<p>All these are active forms of exercise, but there
is another sort which needs mention, viz. the
passive, or massage, as it is termed.
Some people either through general
weakness or some infirmity are
unable to take exercise for themselves, and in
such cases massage is of great benefit, acting in
the same way, but without any exertion on the
part of the patient. The full consideration of
this subject would need a volume of its own, and
this is hardly the place to discuss it in greater
detail. One important fact, however, requires
mention. It is imperative that a prolonged rest
of an hour or two at least should be allowed after
each rubbing. One hour of massage is equivalent
to several hours of active movement.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER <abbr title="13">XXIII.</abbr><br />
<span class="sub_head">BATHS AND BATHING.</span></h2>

<p>The skin plays an important part in eliminating
waste products from the system. It does this by
means of the sweat-glands, which are found
scattered all over the body. These glands have
small ducts, ending in minute apertures on the
surface of the skin. If these apertures are
allowed to become blocked up, either by dirt or
by the natural grease of the body, the skin cannot
carry out its duties. The result is that a certain
amount of this waste matter is kept back,
and the health suffers in consequence sooner or
later.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Hot baths.</div>

<p>Neither cold baths nor outdoor bathing can
get rid of this grease, so that a hot bath occasionally
is essential, even in the
case of people who bathe regularly
every morning, either at
home or out of doors.</p>

<p>The usual objection to hot baths is that people
take cold unless they go straight to bed as soon
as they have dried themselves. Otherwise, so
they say, they go on perspiring and take a chill.
Now this is due, not to their having had a hot
bath, but because the water was not hot enough
when they got out of it. Hot water has the same
effect as cold in bracing up the sweat pores, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
preventing them from continuing to pour out
unnecessary perspiration. Lukewarm water, on
the other hand, leaves the skin lax and moist,
and it is then that people are liable to chills.
Hence the popular idea of running in some cold
water before the bath is finished is a mistake, as
it brings about the very conditions we are anxious
to avoid.</p>

<p>An indispensable adjunct to every bathroom is
a thermometer, by which the temperature of the
water can be accurately gauged. The common
plan of testing it by the hand is fallacious, as the
result depends largely on the state of the hand at
the time. If the fingers are cold when dipped in,
the water feels warmer than it usually is, and
<i>vice versa</i>.</p>

<p>The best temperature at which to take a hot
bath is 100°<abbr title="Fahrenheit">F.</abbr> or just below that. If more water
is added afterwards it should be hot, not cold, so
as to maintain the temperature at the same level.
With the aid of these precautions it will be found
that drying is a simple process, and the skin is left
in a delightful state without any undue perspiration
to follow. So far from causing a liability to
chills, it is perfectly safe to emerge from a bath
of this sort and take a walk immediately after
dressing, even on a winter’s day, without suffering
from any ill-effects. People sometimes complain
that a hot bath makes them feel faint. This is
due to the steam, not to the water itself. If the
windows are kept open this discomfort may be
entirely avoided.</p>

<p>There is nothing more refreshing than a bath of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
this sort, not only in winter, but in hot weather
also, as many athletes are beginning to find out.
After a hard walk or game it effectually relieves
the aching of the limbs, and helps to prevent the
stiffness which is apt to follow. The good effect
of the bath may be increased by massaging the
limbs while they are under water. The proper
way to do this is to grip the muscles between the
two hands, and squeeze them with a sort of
sliding movement towards the extremities, afterwards
kneading them a bit at a time.</p>

<p>Hot baths are an excellent remedy for nausea
or biliousness. A quarter of an hour in a bath at
a temperature of 100°<abbr title="Fahrenheit">F.</abbr> will often be found to
remove all unpleasant symptoms and restore the
appetite and digestion. They are also a boon to
rheumatic persons, helping to banish the muscular
pains and general feeling of malaise.</p>

<p>All this they do by causing the blood to circulate
more freely, and dilating the vessels on the
surface, and in so doing relieving the congestion
in the muscles and internal organs. In this way
they promote the elimination of the waste
products which cause tiredness, fatigue and most
of the other aches and pains from which tired
humanity is liable to suffer. It is not necessary
to wait until bedtime before having a hot bath.
Its most beneficial effects can be obtained by
taking it in the evening on returning from work.
It is then that it is most refreshing, and if made
use of at this time of day, will enable many a man
who has come home fagged out to spend an
enjoyable evening, when otherwise he would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
sitting down too tired to read or take part in
any amusement.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Cold
Baths.</div>

<p>Cold baths do not suit everyone. In fact, there
are comparatively few people who derive any benefit
from them. Many persons find
that if they have one in the morning
before breakfast it leaves them
tired, and with no appetite for the
meal. They only take them because they are
popularly supposed to be invigorating. The
proof of the pudding is in the eating. If a man
feels well, in a comfortable glow, and ready for
his breakfast after them, they are good for him.
If he feels otherwise, and does not enjoy the bath
while he is in it, they are bad for him. There are
some people who dread cold baths, and yet go on
having them from a mistaken sense of duty.
The only explanation is that they must think
they do them good just because they are so
unpleasant, in the same way that some people
have more faith in medicine if it tastes nasty.</p>

<p>Of one thing there is no doubt. Rheumatic
persons and those liable to bronchial affections
should never take them under any circumstances.
Nor should delicate or elderly people make use
of them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The cold
shower.</div>

<p>The disadvantage of a cold bath at home is
that the feet are chilled before the head. And
wetting the hair with cold water
does not get over this inconvenience.
A shower bath, however, does away
with this objection altogether, and
on this account there is no form of cold bath equal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
to it. The head can be held under the water
first, and after that the bather steps in and the
body and limbs receive the shock at the same
time, so that the lower extremities are not chilled
before the rest. The unfortunate part of it is
that so few houses are fitted up with shower
baths.</p>

<p>Whatever form of cold tub is used, it is
advisable to stay in for a very short time only.
Even robust people can rarely stand more than
a few minutes of it.</p>

<p>It is generally supposed that a cold bath should
be taken when the stomach is empty. Such is
not the case, however. While no one would be
so foolish as to take it immediately after a meal,
yet a drink of hot tea or water just before going
in will enable many persons to enjoy and get
benefit from them, who could not do so otherwise.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Outdoor
bathing.</div>

<p>Outdoor bathing, either in sea or river, does not
agree with everyone, although some people can
enjoy a bathe who are unable to
take a cold bath at home. The
common mistake is in bathing
before breakfast, when the system
is at a low ebb, owing to the long abstention from
food. It may be all right for strong young people,
but for many others it is unsuitable and even
dangerous. The best time, as a rule, is about
two hours after breakfast, when the body has been
fortified by the morning meal, and has had time
to digest it.</p>

<p>The great point is to get thoroughly warm
before entering the water. A brisk walk is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
best way of accomplishing this, or if that does not
produce the wished-for result, take a hot drink.
The body heat falls rapidly whilst in the water,
and hence it is advisable to be in a glow before
going in.</p>

<p>For the same reason do not waste time over
your undressing, and always remove the upper
part of the clothing first, leaving the stockings
to the last. It is the feet which are specially
liable to be attacked by the cold, and it is therefore
necessary to keep them warm as long as
possible.</p>

<p>Before taking the plunge, pour cold water over
the head; simply dabbing the hair with it is not
sufficient. After that, get the whole body under
water without any delay, and keep it under all
the time you are in. It is the evaporation from
the surface of the skin which lowers the
temperature, rather than the contact of the body
with the water.</p>

<p>Do not stay in too long. If you remain until
you feel you have had enough, it generally means
that you have had too much. Then dry yourself
rapidly, using two towels, the first to take off the
greater part of the moisture, reserving the second
to dry yourself with thoroughly. Just as you
began undressing from the upper part of the body
downwards, so dry and dress in the inverse order,
rubbing the feet and legs and putting on the
stockings and nether garments first. After that,
if you are feeling chilly, have a hot drink and some
biscuits or other light food.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Turkish
Baths.</div>

<p>Of all forms of baths there is none so refreshing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
as Turkish baths. The hot air which produces
the perspiration also causes it to
evaporate. The sweat-ducts are
cleansed from within as well as
from without by means of the
profuse perspiration, and the relief to the system
is very great.</p>

<p>The patients who benefit most are those suffering
from kidney trouble or rheumatism. In the
latter case the complaint is due to the presence of
excessive waste matter in the tissues; in the
former to the fact that one of the outlets is more
or less deranged. Free sweating is of untold
advantage in both, as it enables the skin to do
double duty and help to eliminate the poisonous
material.</p>

<p>Of late there has been a tendency to treat
common colds and influenza by means of these
baths, but in many cases they only increase the
catarrh, instead of relieving it. Considering the
infectious nature of colds of all sorts too, it is
hardly fair to other people to contaminate the
air in the bathing-rooms.</p>

<p>People with weak hearts, and full-blooded
persons with any tendency to apoplexy, should
avoid Turkish baths, as they are not suitable in
either of these conditions.</p>

<p>The proper way to take them is to devote
plenty of time to the process. On entering, stay
in the first room, the moderately hot one, until
all feeling of oppression has passed off. Then
move on into the second, the hot room as it is
called. The third one, called the oven, should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
never be used, as the heat is too intense to be
safe.</p>

<p>It is best to be content with a mild perspiration
at first, and to stay in too short a time rather than
too long. People are apt to think that the more
they perspire the better they will be. But that
is not the case, and, what is more, there is an
element of danger in prolonging the process. So
much liquid may be abstracted from the system
that the impure matter circulating in the blood
becomes too concentrated, and instead of being
thrown off may be deposited in some muscle or
joint, giving rise to an attack of rheumatism.
In this way the very mischief is precipitated that
we are anxious to avoid. Taken quietly and with
discrimination, Turkish baths are one of the
greatest boons to suffering humanity.</p>

<p>One of the most important details is the rest
afterwards. This should never be less than half
an hour, and an hour or more is preferable when
it can be managed. The whole system needs
this period of rest in order to get back to its
ordinary routine, and without it much of the
benefit of the bath is lost.</p>

<p>Once a week is quite enough, and in many cases
once every two or three weeks is sufficient to keep
the system active and healthy.</p>

<p>One other point should be kept in mind. Seeing
that so much liquid is lost in the form of perspiration
during the process, it is advisable to sip water
freely, both during the process and after it.</p>

<p>If these precautions are observed these baths
will prove beneficial to mind and body alike,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
eliminating the impurities, improving appetite
and digestion, and restoring the sense of vigour
and well-being.</p>

<p>In these ways both Turkish and plain hot water
baths are of the greatest service in preventing the
onset of neurasthenia and its successor, breakdowns.
The time spent in taking them will be
repaid a hundred times in an increased enjoyment
of life and powers of work.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER <abbr title="14">XIV.</abbr><br />
<span class="sub_head">REST.</span></h2>

<p>There are more tired people in the world to-day
than ever before. Nervous exhaustion is taking
the place of the old-fashioned stomach-aches and
coughs and colds as the prevailing complaint of
the times.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Unrest.</div>

<p>There is a spirit of unrest which is having a bad
effect on many nervous systems. The air is dark
with threatened strikes, wars and
rumours of wars, and the clash of
conflicting parties. The sense of
impending calamity fills the minds of many
nervous people with anxious forebodings.
Probably things are not much worse, if any, than
they have often been in previous times, but news
is transmitted to and from all parts of the world
with a swiftness that would have seemed incredible
even a few decades ago. We hear of things that
are happening, not of things that have happened,
and there is a vast difference between the two
so far as comfort of mind is concerned.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Conditions
of modern
life.</div>

<p>Town life has become much more wearing since
petrol has displaced the horse and made the
speed of traffic so vastly greater
than before. And the noise of
motor drays and buses is exercising
a bad effect on many people’s
nerves. They may become so used<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
to the row that they do not appear to notice it,
but its irritating influence on the nervous system
is there all the same.</p>

<p>The ever-increasing stress of competition is
making work a strenuous affair. But what is
worse is the fact that this stress is, with many
persons, invading their hours of leisure. We
grudge no man his pleasures, but when the rush
for amusement is carried on to the detriment
of a body that is already fagged out, it is time
to stop and think where it is all going to
lead to.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Periodic
rest.</div>

<p>The phrase “day and night, Sunday and
week-day” is a significant one. It expresses the
need for periodic rest as imposed
by Nature. Loss of sleep is equally
harmful, whether it be due to work
or pleasure. And whatever views
people may hold in regard to the old-fashioned
Sunday, when considered from a religious point
of view, there is only one when we look at it from
the medical side. Change is rest, as we shall have
occasion shortly to emphasise, but the increasing
tendency to rush off motoring and golfing on
Sundays is not change, for the simple reason
that most of the people who indulge in these
pursuits are the very ones who motor and
golf most days of the week. The old-fashioned
Sabbath was no doubt carried to the opposite
extreme, but it did at any rate infuse an
atmosphere of restfulness, which is lacking in
these days.</p>

<div class="sidenote">What rest
is.</div>

<p>It is not that we wish to encourage idleness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>.
That is a very different thing from rest, which
implies cessation from work. There
is a form of languor due to want of
exercise, and we meet with people
who are always tired because they
lounge about too much. But there are others
who are constantly feeling languid because they
have not learned how and when to take suitable
rest.</p>

<p>Some people are always on the go. They
habitually walk beyond their proper pace and rush
at their work and their amusements with feverish
anxiety. Even when they are playing golf, they
hurry after the ball as though they were afraid
it would run away from them if they did not catch
it up.</p>

<p>To people of this type illness, which is usually
regarded as a misfortune, often proves a blessing
in disguise. For it has one great advantage,
in that it imposes upon the system the much-needed
rest which has been denied it.</p>

<p>We compared the human body to an engine.
Yet in one respect this simile falls short. For
man is a living being, and it is on this account
that he needs something that the engine can do
without. The marvellously delicate machinery
of his body must have rest. An engine is liable
to wear and tear, no matter how well it may be put
together; even if it is made of the best metal to
be obtained, and constructed as nearly perfectly
as possible, there is always bound to be a certain
amount of friction and concussion, which will in
time lower its quality and impair its efficiency.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
But the machinery of the human system is subject
to more than simple wear and tear; for there is,
as we have seen already, a chemical process
constantly taking place, which produces waste
matter that must be drained away every day of our
lives.</p>

<p>Yet in spite of this, it is in a vastly better
position than the engine, for it possesses at the
same time a faculty of self-repair. We cannot
take out parts and replace them by spare ones,
but we do not need to do so. The most marvellous
thing about the human system is the fact that
waste and repair go on simultaneously. But in
order that this may take place the system must
have periodic rest.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Object
of rest.</div>

<p>The object of rest is not merely to add to man’s
happiness and enjoyment, to give him time for
pleasure. It is to recuperate his
body and mind. If he were to go
on using his muscles without
any relaxation they would gradually
waste, and after a time would waste rapidly and
to a serious extent. If he were to exercise his
mind without any respite, the delicate brain-cells
would become exhausted, for like the muscles
they would have no chance of renewing
themselves.</p>

<p>Strong, hardy sailors who have had to undergo
a prolonged physical strain, as in the case of shipwreck,
have been known to suffer ever afterwards
from debility; their hearts and muscles had been
over-exerted to such an extent that they were
never able to recover themselves. And people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
who have had to go through a long stretch of
brain work have lain in a stupor for weeks afterwards,
unable to use their minds or even know
what was going on around them.</p>

<p>Rest is therefore of all considerations of health
the most important, and it demands our closest
attention. Particularly so because it is those
who need it most who find the greatest difficulty
in obtaining it. Active-minded people abhor rest;
to their minds it savours of “doing nothing.”
They do not understand that it is a positive
mode of treatment, and that a definite process of
repair and building up is going on all the time
in the brain-cells and the various tissues of the
body.</p>

<p>The question of rest is simple enough in the
case of animals and human beings of a low order.
The yokel if he feels inclined for a sleep lies down
and takes it just as the dumb creatures do. And
many a man of education and refinement has
envied the tramp his siesta in the roadside ditch.
He would give anything to be able to get a rest
like that whenever he wanted it. His delicately-balanced
nervous system needs repose far more
than that of the tramp or the peasant. Yet,
instead of submitting to lie dormant, it is his
nervous system which keeps him awake. It is
like a fractious child, which will neither go to sleep
nor allow its parents to get their rest.</p>

<p>It is a matter of the utmost consequence,
therefore, to consider in what way rest can most
easily be obtained both for body and mind.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Bodily
rest.</div>

<p>Bodily rest can only be got by having the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
muscles completely relaxed. The ordinary sitting
position in a chair is not sufficient,
as the lower extremities are still
more or less rigid. The chair
should be an easy one, with an
extension or a footstool to support the lower limbs
just a trifle below the level of the body. A better
rest can be had, however, by lying full length on a
couch or bed with the arms and legs sprawling in
the manner adopted by the tramp when he takes
a sleep by the wayside. This attitude assures ease
if not elegance. And it does more than relax the
limbs, for it gives repose to the heart as well.
When the body is in this position the heart beats
more slowly than when we are standing, walking,
or even sitting.</p>

<p>When we consider that from the moment of
birth to that of death this organ is working
incessantly, it is evident that it needs rest more
than any other muscle in the body. Suppose
a hard-working man takes a quarter of an hour’s
loll in the middle of each day; multiply this by
365 and again by the number of his adult years,
and you will have some idea as to the amount of
rest his heart has had by the time he has reached
middle age.</p>

<p>This position of ease and relaxation has a
beneficial effect on the mind also. When we are
thinking hard we instinctively contract our
muscles. The face of the thinker is always
associated with a rigid cast of countenance and
a furrow between the brows. Conversely, when
our muscles are more or less stiffened the mind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
tends to be concentrated at the same time. Relax
the muscles, and the mind also tends to relax.</p>

<p>There is no more efficacious restorative to a
tired body than a hot bath, as hot as it can be
borne, in fact. It should be fairly deep too, so
that the whole body is immersed. Ten minutes
or so of this acts marvellously as a refreshing tonic
to body and mind alike, especially if followed
by a rest in the horizontal position.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Rest of
mind.</div>

<p>Rest for the wearied mind is of even greater
importance than for the body, for a tired brain
is apt to keep the latter on the rack.
Every evening thousands of men
and women reach home too tired to
think and too tired to stop thinking,
especially on the very subject which should be
strictly left alone, viz. their daily work.</p>

<p>It is not unnatural that they should feel tired.
Yet they do not always look at it in this light.</p>

<p>One Sunday evening a parson was sitting by his
fireside with a book in his hand which he was
vainly trying to read. Time after time he had
taken it up, only to put it on one side again after
scanning a few lines. He had a look of utter
weariness and dejection, and every now and then
would start out of his chair and pace restlessly
up and down. It was not the first time he had
gone through this experience, and he was not the
only one of his kind who at that very hour and in
a precisely similar manner was having a bad time
of it.</p>

<p>Now what was it that was troubling him? In
the first place he was tired. That was not to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
wondered at, seeing that he had conducted three
services in the course of the day. Most persons
from the navvy to the king feel tired when their
day’s work is finished, but this does not worry
them. There is no more delightful sensation than
that of real fatigue.</p>

<p>What chiefly troubled him was the fact that
although the book he was trying to read was one
dealing with spiritual matters, he was not only
unable to give his mind to it, but could not even
arouse any interest in the subject. He did not
see that it was the most natural thing in the
world that this should be so. If a surgeon were to
perform three operations in one day, I am quite sure
that he would wish to talk or think about anything
except surgery. And if a pianist gave three
recitals in the day, I believe that the last subject
which would interest him would be music. His
faculty for it, like the surgeon’s for his own art,
would be exhausted for the time being. Why
then should the parson who had thrown all his
spiritual energies into his Sunday’s work be
surprised to find that his active interest in such
matters was in abeyance? His faculties had been
confined to a certain groove all day, and refused
to work any longer on those lines.</p>

<p>That parson was only a type, if a pronounced
one, of many other people, business men, lawyers,
doctors, stockbrokers and any other you can
mention, who cannot make out how it is that if
they think of their work in the evenings they only
worry over it. Yet it forces itself upon their
notice, and they cannot shake it off. They seek<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
rest and find none because they seek it in the
wrong way. They try to sit still and think of
nothing, and that is the most difficult thing on
earth for any intelligent human being to attempt.</p>

<p>We can arrest the movements of the body, but
it is infinitely more difficult to stop the workings
of the mind. The engine is going at full speed,
and we are unable to pull it up. But we can do
something equally efficacious, we can switch it on
to a different line.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Change is
rest.</div>

<p>We can give it change. And change is rest.
There is nothing more wearying to a mind that is
tired and yet strung up than for
any man or woman to sit gazing
moodily at the fire, fretting their
nervous systems with the worries
that should have been left behind. Recreation
is as indispensable to health as food itself.</p>

<p>A fascinating novel, a pleasant game or an
absorbing hobby will afford the wearied brain its
much-needed relaxation.</p>

<p>And when, in one or other of these ways, the
mind has been enabled to settle down into a
quieter groove, it will be in a vastly better condition
to secure the ideal form of rest, nature’s sweet
restorer, sleep.</p>

<p>So important are these considerations, sleep,
recreation and a kindred one, holidays, that they
deserve more than a passing reference. In the
next few chapters, therefore, we shall describe
them more fully.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER <abbr title="15">XV.</abbr><br />
<span class="sub_head">SLEEP.</span></h2>


<p>The ideal form of rest for body and mind is sleep,
for during it the muscles are completely relaxed,
the heart beats quietly, the functions of the
various organs are suspended to a very large
degree, and the brain is in oblivion.</p>

<p>This question is one of paramount importance.
The individual who neglects to secure the
requisite amount of sleep is committing a crime
against himself, for which he will have to pay the
penalty sooner or later. The experience of
centuries has proved that the average man or
woman needs eight hours of it daily, and that
means that they ought to be in bed for eight and
a half hours.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Beauty
sleep.</div>

<p>It is not sufficient that these eight hours should
be taken at any time of the day or night that
happens to be convenient. The old
idea of “beauty sleep” is perfectly
correct, for there is no rest equal to
that obtained during the first part
of the night, and no amount of lying in bed in
the morning can make up for the loss of it.</p>

<p>Ask anyone who has to work at night, nurses,
doctors or workmen on night shift, and they will
tell you without any hesitation that such work
takes twice as much out of them as a corresponding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
amount by day. They will also declare, if you
inquire further, that the sleep they get in the
daytime is not half so refreshing as that obtained
during the night.</p>

<p>Human strength ebbs and flows with the
regularity of the tides, with the difference that
the rise and fall occurs once instead of twice in the
twenty-four hours. The system is at its best
from about six in the morning until the evening.
It is at its worst from about eleven at night until
four in the morning, and during those hours, if
people are awake, either at work or at play, and
even if they have had abundance of sleep during
the course of the day, the heart tends to flag, and
all the powers and faculties are lowered. It is
on that account that people who have to sit up
all night begin to feel chilly and tired in the dead
of night, even though the room itself may be
quite warm. They feel cold and uncomfortable,
simply because their whole systems are depressed.
It is for the same reason that people who are ill
are almost always worse during these hours.</p>

<p>To sit up night after night, even with plenty of
rest in the daytime, is wearing to the system.
To do it without that daily rest would speedily
cause a collapse. And people who habitually
sit up later than they should do, not going to bed
until midnight or after, are in danger of bringing
about the same catastrophe, only in a slower
manner. There is a measure of excitement about
these late hours which makes them alluring.
Many people say that they can work or write
more easily or play cards with greater zest then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
than at any other time, but it is a false form of
stimulant, for which the system has to pay a
heavy price later on.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Remedies for
sleeplessness.</div>

<p>Regular and early hours are essential to health,
and the neglect of them is often the means of
starting a breakdown, or bringing
it to a head. Many cases of
insomnia are due to a want of
punctuality in this respect. And
of all the tortures with which mankind can be
afflicted there is none worse than insomnia, and
none that so surely undermines the nervous
system. One of the most vital points in the
prevention of breakdowns is to consider the
different ways in which sleep can be obtained&mdash;and
to carry them out.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Punctuality
in going
to bed.</div>

<p>To emphasise what we have just said, punctuality
in going to bed is the most important point of all.
The brain, like the digestion, has a
marked tendency to get into
habits, either bad or good. And if
anyone goes to bed at different
times, later on some evenings than
others, the brain is liable to select the latter hour
as the one for falling asleep. This means that
even on the nights when people go to bed in good
time they cannot get to sleep for the next hour or
two. If they would stick to the one hour regularly,
the brain would soon learn to do the same.</p>

<p>Dozing in front of the fire in the evenings is
responsible for many bad nights. The mind gets
into a half-awake, half-sleepy state, which
hinders it from obtaining sound slumber when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
bedtime comes. Even if people are tired and
sleepy at, say, nine o’clock, it is better for them
to read or play a game or move about in order to
avoid falling into a doze.</p>

<p>A brisk walk of ten minutes or so before retiring
is often found to be one of the best sleep-producers.
Or if the weather be too inclement, a few physical
exercises will have the same effect.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Avoid late
suppers.</div>

<p>Late or heavy suppers are a common cause of
insomnia, especially that form of it in which
people fall into a heavy sleep, only
to awake with a start an hour or
two later and find themselves
unable to drop off again until early
morning perhaps.</p>

<p>Digestion comes almost to a dead stop during
sleep, so that sufficient time should be allowed
for the last meal to be disposed of before the
hour for retiring. This interval should be two
hours at least, which means that half-past eight
is, as a rule, late enough for the evening meal.
In any case, the food which is taken then ought
to be of a light nature, and not include pork, cold
meat, or any other article of diet which is slow of
digestion. Coffee and strong tea, especially
Indian tea, are unsuitable at this hour, as they
tend to cause sleeplessness of themselves. Cocoa,
made with water, is a much better beverage for
use with the evening meal or after it.</p>

<p>Sometimes, however, too long an interval
between the last meal and bedtime will prevent
sleep, as in the case of those who take high tea
at half-past six, or dinner at seven or thereabouts.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
Under these circumstances light refreshments, in
the shape of a few biscuits with a light drink of
some sort, will assist sleep.</p>

<p>For those who still, in spite of attention to these
points, suffer from insomnia, the following hints
will be of service.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The bed
and bedding.</div>

<p>The bed should be neither too soft nor too hard.
If the former, as when feather beds are used,
people are apt to fall into a deep
sleep and wake up later feeling half
smothered. If too hard, the body
cannot rest properly. The bedclothes
should not be too heavy. An eiderdown
quilt is worth several blankets for warmth. If
means will not permit of this luxury, two or three
sheets of brown paper will answer the same
purpose, affording the maximum of warmth with
the minimum of weight. The personal clothing,
too, should be warm but not heavy, and above all
the feet must not be allowed to get cold. The use
of night socks will often cure insomnia, which has
proved stubborn to all other modes of treatment.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Ventilation.</div>

<p>The room should be well ventilated. This is
of the utmost importance, and an additional
benefit can be obtained by pulling
the bed away from the wall, if only
for a few inches, to allow of a free
circulation of air all round.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sip
hot water.</div>

<p>An excellent plan is to sip hot water at bedtime,
not too much of it, but as hot as it can be taken.
It is not advisable to put spirits
into it, as in that case the dose has
to be increased before long in order
to maintain the good effect. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
hot bath, or putting the feet into hot water, is of
great use in many cases.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Simulate
sleep.</div>

<p>On lying down it is a good plan to take long,
deep, slow breaths for five or ten minutes. At
the same time relax the eyes, in
the same way as in gazing at the
distant horizon or into space, of
course keeping the eyelids closed.
These two points simulate sleep to a certain
extent, and are a valuable means of obtaining it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Reading
in bed.</div>

<p>Reading in bed is not a good habit, as many
persons have found that once they have begun
the custom they cannot get to
sleep without it. At the same time,
if anyone has been lying awake for
hours it is better to turn up the
light and read a book than to lie awake in the
dark, thinking and worrying of one thing after
another. There is no time when life looms so
hopeless and forbidding as it does when you
cannot sleep. A better plan, however, is to walk
about the room for a few minutes, or to sit up in
bed and keep the eyes open as long as possible
without blinking. It happens not uncommonly
that after doing this people fall asleep as soon as
they lie down again.</p>

<p>The aimless wandering of the mind from one
subject to another and back again may be
prevented by repeating a piece of poetry to oneself.
Needless to say, it must be something with which
we are thoroughly acquainted, otherwise the
effort to remember what is coming next will of
itself prove a barrier to sleep.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Fresh air
as a soporific.</div>

<p>The best remedy of all is to spend a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
whole day in the open air. This will often
break the sleepless habit, and
once a good night’s rest has
been obtained others will be
likely to follow.</p>

<p>There is one other hint which sounds like
an old wife’s tale. We do not pretend to be
able to explain it, but experience has proved
its efficacy in many instances. People have
found that they can sleep better with the head
pointing to the north than in any other position.
Every method, however simple or inexplicable,
is worth a trial, for there is no condition so
distressing as insomnia, or so likely to lead to the
much-dreaded neurasthenia.</p>

<p>People often complain that they cannot sleep
well in the summer-time. This is owing to the
fact of the mornings being light at such an early
hour. This can be remedied with the best results
to the whole system by the plan of having dark
green blinds fitted inside the windows.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Massage.</div>

<p>Those who, through some illness or infirmity,
cannot take exercise, will find the greatest
benefit from massage. If skilled
massage cannot be obtained, gentle
rubbing of the limb will fulfil the
same useful purpose.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER <abbr title="16">XVI.</abbr><br />
<span class="sub_head">HOLIDAYS.</span></h2>

<p>The greatest mistake than can be made is to wait
for an annual holiday in the expectation that it is
going to exonerate us from consequences of eleven
months or more of sinning against the rules of
health. Everyone, men and women alike, should
secure a holiday if only for an hour or so every
day of their lives, in the shape of some congenial
change of thought or occupation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Value of
the annual
holiday.</div>

<p>Yet the annual holiday has a place of its own
in our well being. It takes us away from our
ordinary associations, and brings
us into contact with fresh scenery
and new faces, which mean new
personalities. It invigorates our
bodies and tones up our minds,
broadening them and furnishing them with new
ideas, so that both from the physical and mental
standpoints it is a valuable aid to health.</p>

<p>It has a direct bearing on the subject of breakdowns,
for change of scene is a potent means of
getting a man’s mind out of the monotonous
groove which is so wearing to his nervous system.
It has an additional advantage in that it often
happens that after a holiday he is apt to keep
himself in contact with the fresh air and exercise,
and recreation also, which he found so beneficial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
when he was away from home. In the incipient
stages of breakdown, too, a complete change is
one of the necessary items in treatment.</p>

<p>Seeing, therefore, how important it is and what
it means to so many people, it is well worth while
to consider how the time and money involved
may be expended to the best advantage.</p>

<p>The usual plan is to fix on a spot because we
have heard it spoken of as a “nice place to go to,”
engage rooms by letter and set off, hoping for the
best. Little wonder that the holiday often turns
out a disappointment.</p>

<p>A family was returning from a visit to the
seaside, to which the various members, parents
and children alike, had looked forward with the
greatest zest. The mother was tired out, the
father seemed worried, and the children were
jaded and spiritless. They had been unfortunate
in their choice of a place, the lodgings had been
uncomfortable, and the holiday had proved a
failure. Yet with a little foresight it might have
been entirely different.</p>

<p>It is always advisable that one of the older
members of the family, preferably the mother,
should see the locality and the apartments
before hand. We cannot expect the proprietress
of the apartments or the hotel to point
out for our benefit that the bedrooms are
musty and badly ventilated, the sheets damp,
and the sanitary arrangements defective. We
must go and investigate these things for
ourselves.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Where to
go.</div>

<p>The question as to where to go is one that needs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
careful consideration. The fact that it suited
someone else is no reason why it
should be adapted to our requirements.
I once heard two men
discussing this question, and one
was advising the other to go to a certain place in
the Highlands. He described it in glowing
colours, and made it perfectly plain to the other
man that if he went anywhere else he was an
incompetent idiot. It was a village at the bottom
of a deep valley, surrounded on all sides by lofty
mountains.</p>

<p>“What do you do with yourself if the weather
is wet?” the second man asked.</p>

<p>“Well, of course you have to stay indoors.”</p>

<p>“And what do you do when it is fine?”</p>

<p>“Oh, you climb the mountains.”</p>

<p>“Well, seeing that my wife suffers from a weak
heart, and cannot climb an ordinary hill, I think
we shall go somewhere else,” which he very
wisely did. It is not much use going to a place
if you have either to forego the pleasures
of the holiday or run the risk of injuring your
health.</p>

<p>People who suffer from asthma are often worse
at the seaside, and should always take this into
consideration. Those liable to bronchial attacks
should be wary as to visiting the East Coast.
They will derive more benefit from the softer
atmosphere of the South or West.</p>

<p>It is a mistaken idea to suppose that people who
are run down will get the most good from going
to a bracing climate. Often it has the effect of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
making them irritable and restless, and their nerves
do better in a more relaxing place.</p>

<p>A fortnight on a farm always sounds attractive,
but in reality it often turns out the very opposite.
The accommodation is apt to be of a primitive
order, and the cooking by no means up to the
mark, while it is not uncommon to find that
none of the bedroom windows will open. So
much, too, depends upon the weather, and if it
happens to be wet, the holiday is likely to be
devoid of pleasure, and detrimental to health at
the same time. Rheumatic people should avoid
farmhouses, as the atmosphere is often damp,
especially in the evenings. Even if the weather
is fine, there is a danger in the dew which rises
from the fields at sunset. If it is wet, the
consequences are apt to be serious. A seaside
place with a light, sandy soil is better adapted
to such persons.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Continental
trips.</div>

<p>In these days of quick and cheap travel no paper
on holidays is complete without a reference to
the problem of continental trips.
These are undoubtedly a source of
interest, but not necessarily of
health. It may be a delight to see
fresh places and experience new national customs
and a totally different diet, but in many cases
these advantages are obtained at the expense of
bodily health. People who are run down rarely
get any benefit from them. Even if they have
the sense to make for one place and stay there or
use it as a centre, the long railway journey tires
them to such an extent that they cannot enjoy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
their holiday properly. Usually a visit to some
home resort is of infinitely greater value.</p>

<p>As a rule, however, a continental trip means one
of the advertised tours, in which a maximum of
travelling and sight-seeing is carried out in a
minimum of time. People who are strong
enough to undertake such a task do not come
under the category of health-seekers.</p>

<p>When the journey, either home or foreign,
includes a sea-trip, it is well to take only light
food for a day or two previously, if you are
subject to <i>mal de mer</i>, and also to take a good
aperient the day before starting. These precautions
will often serve to avoid the biliousness
which so frequently spoils the first few days of
the holiday.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Preparations.</div>

<p>In making preparations for a holiday it is
necessary to be ready for all sorts of weather.
The day may be tropical when we
start, and like winter the next day,
and it is both uncomfortable and
dangerous to have brought nothing but light
summer clothing. There is an old superstition
that people do not catch cold by the sea. This is
a huge mistake, as they are just as liable to do so
as at home, often more so in fact, as home comforts
are missing. It is a pitiable sight to see numbers
of people wandering about a seaside resort on a
damp, chilly day, looking cold and miserable,
simply because they think it their duty to dress
in flannels while they are on a holiday.</p>

<p>That phrase “on a holiday” covers a multitude
of sins. People seem to think that they can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
dispense with all the precautions they would find
necessary at home, and that they will escape the
consequences of running needless risks because
they happen to be at the seaside or in the country.</p>

<p>The result is that many people complain that
they feel tired and headachy when they are on a
holiday, and that much of their pleasure is spoiled
in consequence. They attribute it to the fact
of the air being too strong for them, or else that
it is the reaction from previous overwork. It is
neither one nor the other, but is due to something
quite different.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Diet on a
holiday.</div>

<p>For one thing, most people eat too much when
they are away, a great deal more than they would
dare to take at home. Often, too,
they indulge in things which they
know to disagree with them in an
ordinary way. The consequence is
that they become dyspeptic, and their livers get
out of order. That is why they have headaches
and get tired so easily. If they could take less
rather than more, and eschew all those things
which do not suit them, the value of the holiday
would be considerably enhanced. In the case of
men, smoking to an excess they would never
dream of at home has a similar effect in producing
a feeling of lassitude.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Exercise.</div>

<p>The amount of exercise has a pronounced
influence on the good of a holiday. People
who have been overworked or
ill, or have neglected to take
regular exercise at home, should
be extremely careful as to exertion when on a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
vacation, particularly during the first few days.
A man who had saved up for a long time to have
a fortnight among the mountains did so much
climbing on the first day that he was knocked up
for the remainder of his stay. Many others,
without going to extremes such as this, feel
languid all the time from the same cause. They
try to make up for lost time at home by doing as
much as possible in the weeks at their disposal,
and think it a crime to miss any opportunity of
getting about. They walk more in a day than
they do in a week at home, and are surprised to
find that instead of feeling braced up they are
listless and tired out.</p>

<p>Unwonted forms of exercise, too, such as many
persons indulge in when away from home, are
responsible for more than the spoiling of their
enjoyment. For example, it is not necessary
for them to bathe simply because they are at
the seaside and everybody else is having a dip.
Numbers of people in good health do not feel
well for the rest of the day after a bathe, but in
other cases the results may be more serious.
Those who are run down, or broken down, or are
recovering from an illness, had better avoid
entering the water. Otherwise they run the risk
of bringing about a recurrence of their malady.</p>

<p>Exercise of all sorts is an admirable thing, but
like many other good things in this world it has
to be used with discretion. For alongside it there
is the companion virtue rest, and this aspect of a
holiday has always to be kept well to the fore,
especially in the case of those who are feeling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
jaded or depressed, restless, nervous or irritable,
or present any sign of incipient neurasthenia or
breakdown.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The restful
holiday.</div>

<p>For people of this type a restful holiday is
essential above all things. But this does not
mean that they are to go to some
quiet spot with no company except
their own thoughts. It needs a
peculiar temperament, such as few
of us possess, to spend a fortnight lying under a
hedge or on the sands in some secluded place,
with hardly a soul to speak to. It is all very
well in theory, but in practice it usually amounts
to the very opposite. The body may be rested,
but the mind is apt to be kept on the go. Black
care rides behind the horseman, and a man’s
worries too often accompany him and refuse to
be driven away, unless he has some amusement
or interest to divert his thoughts.</p>

<p>If people happen to be ardent lovers of Nature,
they may find diversion in some place noted for
its scenery. Unfortunately, however, the
neurasthenic is easily bored, and no matter
how beautiful his surroundings may be, he
should take care to furnish himself beforehand
with plenty of literature suited to his needs.
The local library is often interesting when regarded
from the point of view of the antique, but it is
often hopeless as a means of securing anything
worth reading.</p>

<p>In many cases people who run down need
something of a lighter, we might say a more
frivolous nature. Their taste for scenery, like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
many of their other faculties, is tired out for the
time being. Taken all round, the best place for
the neurasthenic is a lively seaside resort, where
he can sit about and amuse himself with watching
the doings of the people around him. Everything
in this world has a place, and a troop of nigger
minstrels or a Punch and Judy show may afford
rest and relaxation to a wearied mind when
mountain scenery has failed to do so.</p>

<p>In either case one thing is essential. The
scenery or the amusements must be obtained with
a minimum amount of fatigue. On this account
it is necessary to select a place mild enough to
permit of sitting out of doors. That is why in the
great majority of cases the neurasthenic gets on
much better in a warm, if relaxing, climate.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Tired eyes.</div>

<p>One other point we must emphasise particularly.
Many visitors, whether they are run down or in
good health, suffer from headaches
when on a holiday simply because
of tired eyes. They want to enjoy
the full benefit of the air, and are also ambitious
to return home sunburnt, so walk about without
any proper shade to the eyes. They succeed in
getting tanned, but much of the pleasure of their
vacation is spoiled owing to a constant feeling of
ache and oppression in the head. A wide hat-brim
or a pair of smoked glasses will avert this,
and add to their enjoyment in proportion as
they do so.</p>

<p>For the same reason a good rest in a shady
room in the middle of the day is of the greatest
value. It rests not only the eyes but everything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
else as well. People regret the waste of a single
minute when they are taking a hard-earned
holiday, and often ruin the good of it by staying
out of doors until they are too tired to enjoy
themselves. An hour’s rest in the house after
the midday meal will be found to make their
holiday worth twice as much as it would be
otherwise.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Returning
home.</div>

<p>It is always a pity to spoil the good effect of a
holiday by returning home at the last possible
minute, late at night it may be.
Better lose half a day of the vacation
than get up next morning to
resume work tired out and utterly
unfit for it. For this will rob the holiday of those
pleasant recollections which are one of its greatest
boons.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER <abbr title="17">XVII.</abbr><br />
<span class="sub_head">RECREATION. HOBBIES.</span></h2>

<div class="sidenote">Games.</div>

<p>Recreation may be divided into games, reading
and hobbies. Games occupy a useful part in
daily life. Indoor ones form a
pleasant way of passing the time,
and helping to take the mind off
work and everything else that tends to cause
worry or fatigue.</p>

<p>Outdoor ones tempt people to fresh air and
exercise, and thus constitute a valuable aid to
health. And games of all sorts do one thing,
they teach people to take a beating in good part.
By games we mean of course the playing, not the
watching of them. One game even badly
played is worth fifty hours of looking on while
others take part, even if they are experts and
play vastly better than we could ever do.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Hobbies.</div>

<p>Yet games necessitate having someone to play
with, and there are many times in our lives
when we cannot have anyone else
to take a part. That is the great
advantage of hobbies, they can
be enjoyed in solitude.</p>

<p>Not that we have any wish to drive people to
solitude, for there is nothing worse than being
alone too much. Solitary people are very apt
to become too introspective, and that is always a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
bad thing for their nervous systems. If people
avoid the society of their fellow-men they acquire
an undue sense of their own importance, and their
own affairs loom too largely in their thoughts.
Furthermore, they are liable to become depressed,
and to develop that mixture of conceit and
diffidence which is of all things most objectionable.</p>

<p>It is because solitude is inevitable that we are
anxious to lay stress on those things which will
effectually prevent that morbid introspection and
make life brighter and happier. And hobbies
fulfil both these requirements. There are
thousands of people who are doomed to live in
lodgings. They have no one at hand to join
them in a game, and unless they have some
congenial occupation wherewith to occupy their
minds, life becomes a poor, dull affair.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Hobbies and
home life.</div>

<p>It often happens, too, that those who have the
privileges of family life have to depend on themselves
for their own amusement at
times. The other people in the
house may be busy or disinclined
to take part in any game. Besides
that, games are apt to pall in time; you cannot
carry them on indefinitely. Then it is that a
hobby becomes a priceless boon. It does more
than enliven solitude, it makes all the difference
to home-life also.</p>

<p>A man returned home after a hard day at
business, and after he had had his meal sat down
and spent the evening gazing with a bored, tired
countenance into the fire, a cheerful spectacle for
his poor wife, who had also had a worrying day,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
and would have been glad of a little brightness.
The boys and girls had even to be sent out of the
room, as their talking made father’s head ache.</p>

<p>As he sat there his one thought was of his work.
It was all he had to think about, for he had never
cultivated any pursuits or broadened his interests
in any way. And running the mind in one groove
is, like singing on one note, a tiring occupation.
That man was always tired, body and soul. Of
late, too, he had had another worry, for he had
found himself becoming more nervous and
irritable, and with less confidence in his own
powers. The dread had come upon him that he
was going to break down. And as he thought of
his wife and family, who would be left insufficiently
provided for, it nearly broke his heart.</p>

<p>Twelve months later if you had gone to that
same house you would have seen the table littered
with prints and negatives. Blessed be untidiness,
of that sort at any rate; it generally means, like
the dirt on a boy’s face, that someone is happy.
There were no tired looks now, and no sending
the young people out of the room. Instead,
everyone was cheerful, everyone talking at once,
and as for father, you would not have known
him. Even the children did not know what was
coming over him, he was getting so jolly. His
friends, too, and he had more of them of late
than he used to have, were glad to meet him,
instead of fighting shy of him as an old bore like
they used to do.</p>

<p>The secret of it all was that he had been to a
lecture on birds, and the lecturer had described<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
the fascination of photographing them in their
haunts. He had taken it up, and the result was
that he had seen more than birds, for his eyes
had been opened to all the beauties of Nature, and
he had found the world a very pleasant place to
live in after all. The fresh air and exercise which
he had enjoyed whilst following his new bent had
banished his dyspepsia, his headaches had
disappeared, and he had forgotten all about the
palpitation and vague pains and discomforts
that used to worry the life out of him.</p>

<p>His nervous system had taken a new lease of
life. He had lost all his dreads and forebodings,
and had regained his old confidence in business
matters. The old wearing monotony of life had
gone, and his brain was alive and keen with varied
interests, for no hobby comes alone, it invariably
brings its friends along with it. And the more
the merrier.</p>

<p>This welcome change in his manner of spending
his evenings, the change from wearisome brooding
to congenial pastime, had given to his mind the
repose it had stood so badly in need of, and for
want of which it had been slowly but surely
drifting towards a breakdown. For the latter
is due, as we have already seen, to a gradual
disorganisation of the various functions of the
body undermining the nervous system. And a
hobby such as this, combining indoor and outdoor
pursuits, does more than relieve the tedium of a
tired brain, it invigorates every organ and tissue
in the body.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Hobbies
in the
treatment of
breakdowns.</div>

<p>And they not only act as a direct preventive of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
breakdowns themselves, but they are an invaluable
aid to other forms of treatment.
If a lethargic person is ordered to
take exercise, it is a constant
difficulty to keep him up to it,
unless he has some other inducement.
Get him to take up some
outdoor pursuit, such as gardening or natural
history in one or other of its multifarious phases,
and he will have exercise in abundance without
knowing that he is taking it. Numbers of men
would be vastly better in health, too, if they had
more exercise after reaching home, especially on
winter evenings, instead of sitting by the fire
until bedtime. If told to take up physical drill,
they may go on with it for a time, but will almost
certainly get tired of these duty exercises after a
while. Persuade them to take up wood carving or
carpentry, and they will get all that they need and
a large measure of enjoyment at the same time.</p>

<p>Many a case of gout, dyspepsia, sluggish liver
and such-like ailments in stout, plethoric persons
can be cured by this means more effectually than
by any other.</p>

<p>Or it may be that patients are ordered rest,
because of some overstrain, or a weakness in some
particular organ, as the lungs or heart. It is
difficult enough to secure this rest in the case of
a woman, but in that of a man it is wellnigh
impossible. There is no more restless being than
a man who is either confined to the house or
unable to walk far. He gets tired of reading and
playing “Patience,” and the result is that in most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
instances he moons about aimlessly, a nuisance
to himself and to those around him. Once let
him take up some hobby which will interest him,
and the case becomes entirely different. He can
take his camera and photograph places or people,
near at hand or farther away according to his
powers of walking, and can find ample occupation
in the evenings or on wet days, developing,
printing and arranging the pictures he has taken.</p>

<p>Or he can take his specimen case and spend
whole days quietly hunting for wild flowers, birds’
eggs, or anything else he is inclined for, and
obtain a vast amount of pleasure afterwards in
setting out his treasures. Or he can do a bit of
gardening, heavy or light according to his
capabilities, and if he has a greenhouse he can fill
up his time profitably when the state of the
weather does not permit of outside work.</p>

<p>Hobbies have ceased to be regarded simply as
a means of putting in time, and have come to
occupy an important part in medical treatment.
Consumptive sanatoria, for instance, present a
very different appearance now from what they
did some years ago. At that time the visitor
was met with the pitiable spectacle of a melancholy
array of dispirited patients, lying about in all
stages of dejection. Now he sees men and women
engaged in gardening and other outdoor pursuits,
looking as if they were thoroughly enjoying
themselves, which is just what they <em>are</em> doing.</p>

<p>The same benefit from such pursuits is found
in all cases where fresh air is required, as in
anæmia, neurasthenia, etc. An outdoor hobby<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
secures the fresh air, and supplies the best of
tonics for nervous systems. And when breathing
exercises are ordered at the same time, the easiest
way to ensure their being carried out is to induce
the patient to learn singing, which is the best and
most agreeable form in which they can be applied.</p>

<p>As to the stage of convalescence from any
illness, any medical man will testify that people
who have hobbies get well very much sooner than
those who have not. And in this case, as in all
those of people whose lives and movements are
limited owing to some physical weakness, if they
have no such pursuits to brighten their lives, the
incessant worrying and brooding are very liable
to result in neurasthenia, which is the half-way
house to breakdowns.</p>

<p>And for those of my readers who still retain
the priceless gift of health, and wish to retain it,
a hobby is better than all the riches in the world.
It is independent of riches, too, for anyone can
cultivate it, the poor as easily as the wealthy.
More easily, in fact, for the more difficult a thing
is to acquire the more we enjoy it when we have
secured it. The man or woman who can fill their
house with treasures of art and literature simply
by signing a cheque rarely appreciate what they
have got.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Choice of a
hobby.</div>

<p>When making a start take up anything, it does
not matter what. One hobby leads to another,
and it leads to something else,
which is one of the most potent aids
to health. For no sooner has
anyone begun a fresh pursuit than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
they meet with someone who is interested in the
same subject. A hobby has been the means of
the beginning of many a lifelong friendship. And
a congenial friendship is the best remedy for the
headaches and heartaches and soulaches with
which lonely people are so often afflicted, to the
detriment of their nervous systems.</p>

<p>For those who wish to cultivate some hobby to
act as an evening pastime, and give the mind its
needed rest, it is important to choose one that is
a contrast to their daily occupation. If they
work with their brains all day, they should take
up some pursuit that involves manual exercise.
If they are working all day with their hands, they
are better advised to fix on one that makes a call
upon the mind, without much physical exertion.
They may start a course of reading, for instance.</p>

<p>Now reading implies either amusement or
instruction, or the two combined, as in the case
of history or travel. In these days both these
subjects are presented in a form that is not only
an education, but also a welcome relaxation to
the tired brain. It is a relief sometimes to have
our minds carried back to the ages, and realise
that the troubles which beset us are just the same
as those from which people have suffered right
down through the centuries.</p>

<p>We can have all the pleasures of travel without
the disadvantages&mdash;gazing at the ruins of some
Indian temple without being suffocated by the
heat, or wandering in tropical forests without
being bitten to death by mosquitoes and running
the risk of malaria.</p>

<p>Or if the eyes be too tired for reading, there are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
hosts of other pursuits which will render agreeable
diversion to the mind. A husband and wife who
spend their evenings, the one with music or some
interesting hobby, and the other with her fancy
work or French painting, are more likely to be
“happy though married,” than if they sit in their
chairs to a growling accompaniment of the day’s
worries and a querulous account of the servants’
doings.</p>

<p>Life without a hobby is like a dinner without
salt; it may be inoffensive, but there is a sad
lack of relish about it.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER <abbr title="18">XVIII.</abbr><br />
<span class="sub_head">WORK.</span></h2>

<p>Work is the natural heritage of mankind. “Man
goeth forth unto his work and to his labour until
the evening.” He does so in order to get the means
of livelihood. Yet even those who inherit sufficient
to make them independent must work also. They
may not have to work in order to live, but they
must of a certainty work in order to live healthily.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Necessity
for work.</div>

<p>A certain statesman, well endowed with this
world’s goods, has been known to say that even
when he is out of office and on a
holiday, he finds it necessary to his
personal comfort to study hard for
at least two or three hours each
day, otherwise his nerves and his heart begin
to trouble him. And while making due allowance
for patriotism and sense of duty, there is no
doubt that many men who do not need to work
for a living take up work of some sort or other,
politics, the army, or whatever else takes their
fancy, because they feel vastly better for having
something definite to do.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Work
as mental
exercise.</div>

<p>Work affords systematic exercise for the mind,
and a mind to be healthy needs exercise as much
as the body does. Why is it, then,
that if work is indispensable to our
bodily welfare from a health point of
view we all look forward so eagerly
to the time when we can retire and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
leave it behind us? Yet that seems to be the
goal towards which we are most of us striving.
And it is an aimless one, unless a man has some
pursuit by means of which he can use and enjoy
his years of leisure, some absorbing hobby or
public work of one sort or other. It is the man
who has applied himself so closely to his business
or profession as to have deadened his interest in
other matters, who finds retirement such a
deadly dull affair.</p>

<div class="sidenote">How to
work and be
healthy.</div>

<p>It is often said that a man does his best work
before he is forty. The cry is for young men in
every branch of employment, and
those who have reached middle age
stand a poor chance if they are so
unfortunate as to lose their situations.
Yet their experience ought
to make them more useful and indispensable than
at any previous stage in their career. A man of
fifty-five complained to me some years ago that
he was being put on the shelf on account of his
age. “Yet I am better fitted to do my work
than I have ever been,” he said.</p>

<p>It is quite true that he was better fitted for it
from the point of view of experience and judgment.
Yet he was a confirmed dyspeptic, and was always
taking cold, necessitating frequent absences from
his work, which was a responsible one. And it is
just on this very account that there is a demand
for younger and stronger men to-day. Employers
prefer a man who is warranted to turn up when
he is wanted, rather than a more experienced one
who is liable to be at home indisposed at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
very time when his services are most urgently
needed. They say quite rightly, “We cannot
afford to have a man who is in danger of
breaking down.”</p>

<p>Most of the breakdowns that we meet with are
put down to work or overwork. It is, therefore,
looking at the matter from the personal point of
view, a burning question as to how work can be
carried out without bringing in its train this
much-dreaded climax. In other words, “How
to work and be healthy.”</p>

<p>It is folly to go blindly on, as so many do,
hoping for the best, and taking no steps to make
sure of it. It is not work, but the conditions under
which it is done, that accounts for the loss of
health which so often accompanies it. And
much of this loss, and most of the breakdowns
which occur as a result of it, may be avoided
by a careful, practical study of the whole
question.</p>

<p>We need to look at it from three points: before,
during, and after work.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Before
work.</div>

<p>If a man lies in bed until the last minute
dresses in a hurry, perhaps cutting his chin while
shaving and losing his shirt stud,
bolts down his breakfast in the
fewest possible minutes, and then
runs to catch his tram or train, it
is not to be wondered at if he returns home in the
evening thoroughly fagged out. He has started
the day by breaking nearly every rule of health
in the course of about three-quarters of an hour,
and is surprised and worried because he finds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
that his work takes such a lot out of him. Yet
next morning he begins by doing the very same
thing over again.</p>

<p>Then he sighs for the time when he will be able
to rest on his oars and take life easily, leaving
“the beastly business” behind him. And so
long as he goes on in the way he is doing, he will
sigh for it in vain. He may feel thankful if he is
able to go on with his work, and does not find
himself laid on one side, broken down in health
and spirits.</p>

<p>Try an experiment, some of you who see
yourselves in the picture I have just drawn.
Get up in good time, and that means going to bed
in good time also the night before. Dress and
take your breakfast in a leisurely manner, and
then either go for a turn in the garden or farther
afield if you like, or else have a quiet rest by the
fireside, if the weather is inclement. Give
yourself plenty of time to get to your place of
business, and at the end of the day you will be
in a position to decide as to whether it was your
work or your way of starting the day which was
to blame.</p>

<p>Of one thing we have little doubt. Even if you
do not feel as well as you might do when you
reach home again, you will feel better than you
have done for a long time past. But not
so well as you may do before long. For
there are different ways of going about your
work, as well as of preparing for it and getting
there.</p>

<div class="sidenote">During work.
Hygiene.</div>

<p>It is astonishing how many people there are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
who are careful as to ventilation and such-like
matters in their own homes, but
will put up with all sorts of hygienic
defects in their offices. They will
sit with their heads or their feet in
cold draughts in the winter time and in baking
hot rooms in the summer. A strip of wood under
the door, or a curtain over it, the removal of a
desk to a more convenient position, or the fixing
of a sunblind, as the case may be, would make
all the difference in the world to their comfort
and health. Yet they put up with these inconveniences,
and go on taking colds and headaches,
just because it is an office or a place of business
and not a private house.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Noises.</div>

<p>Noises in the street outside are a frequent cause
of tiredness. Through long custom people fail to
hear them, and become unaware of
their existence, but the consequent
nervous tension is there all the same.
No expenditure in the shape of mechanical contrivances,
even if it necessitates some re-building,
is too great if it can mitigate this constant source
of irritation to the nervous system.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Telephone.</div>

<p>As to the telephone, we are almost afraid to
mention it, simply because we have no remedy
to suggest. There is no doubt that
it has increased the stress and
strain of work considerably, not
merely by forcing the pace, but also by its direct
effect on the nerves of the head.</p>

<p>We are only able to offer one piece of advice,
and that, we fear, a poor one. It is this. Do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
not lose your temper if it is not working properly.
It may be a source of satisfaction to tell the
operator at the Exchange exactly what you
think of him and the system in general, but
invective is like a boomerang, it often does more
damage to the thrower than to anyone else.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Bad light.</div>

<p>One of the common causes of strain is the habit
of writing in a bad light, or with the eyes facing
the light. Nothing causes the brain
more discomfort than a constant
glare of light on the face, or trying
to read or write in a poor light. And there is no
need for it. It must be a poor sort of office where
the window, or artificial means of lighting, cannot
be so arranged as to illuminate the paper without
causing any strain on the eyesight.</p>

<p>Whether headaches be due to this or any other
cause, they should never be neglected, especially
if they are liable to come on while at work. For
repeated headaches, even though they may be
but slight, have a wearing effect on the brain and
other parts of the nervous system. They may
be due to most trivial causes in some cases,
which is all the more pity why they should be
allowed to persist. A man who was at the head
of a large firm once consulted a doctor because
he found that his work took it out of him more
than before. The medical man noticed that the
patient was slightly deaf, though the latter did
not seem to be aware of the fact. On examination,
the ears were found to be blocked with wax, the
removal of which restored the man to his usual
state of health and vigour. It had been simply<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
the strain of trying to hear what was being said
which had produced a constant sense of fatigue.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Midday rest.</div>

<p>There is one custom which in these busy times
tends to be dying out. It is that of the midday
meal rest, the old-fashioned forty
winks. “There is no time for it
now,” people say. But there is
time for everything, if we choose to make it.
The head of one of the largest firms in this country
used to insist on this rest, no matter how urgent
the matters might be that needed his attention.
He kept a couch in his private office, and each day,
as soon as he had had his lunch, he locked the
door, and for twenty minutes took a comfortable
rest and snooze. And woe betide anyone who
disturbed him. It was to this custom that he
attributed the fact that he had retained his
faculties and vigour to an age at which most of his
confrères were dead or broken down.</p>

<p>Some may prefer to have a walk in the fresh
air, and if their occupation is a sedentary one
and they have been cooped up in an office all the
morning, it will probably suit them better than
lying down.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Intervals
between
meals.</div>

<p>It is not uncommon to find cases in which there
is over-fatigue because the intervals between the
meals is too long, apart from any
circumstances which interfere with
them. A man gets his breakfast
at eight o’clock and his lunch at
half-past one it may be. He
objects to eating between meals, so takes nothing
for the whole of that time. Now this for most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
people is too long; the system becomes exhausted,
and has to do its work without proper nourishment.
This means that it has to draw upon the
reserve forces, and while this may be done now
and then, it cannot be repeated often without
depleting them. Many people would find the
greatest benefit from a little light refreshment in
the course of the morning. They do not need
much: a cup of coffee or soup, or a glass of milk
and a biscuit, are quite sufficient to keep them
going until the luncheon hour.</p>

<p>For the same reason a cup of tea with bread
and butter or cake about four o’clock or thereabouts
is an excellent thing. And like the
morning snack, it provides more than nourishment,
for it necessitates a break and a breath of fresh
air, which invigorate the nervous system, and
often enable a man to reach home fresh and well,
when otherwise he would get there jaded and tired.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Nature of
work.</div>

<p>Sometimes it is the nature of the work which
imposes a special strain. Great responsibilities
and grave issues may have to be
met, as in the case of contractors,
stockbrokers, etc. An enormous
degree of nervous tension may have
to be concentrated into a few minutes. There is
no escaping from it, we know. Yet the man who
has consistently looked after his health, not only
in the mornings before setting out but at all
other times, is in a much more satisfactory state
to deal with such emergencies and to bear the
strain of them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Working
against time.</div>

<p>Often it is working against time which does the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
harm. Sometimes this rush cannot be helped.
The journalist, for instance, must
have his news or his leader ready
by a certain hour. The newspaper,
like time and tide, cannot wait.
Yet at other times it <em>can</em> be helped. A man finds
that if he goes on for another hour, instead of
going to his lunch or dinner at the proper time,
he can finish what there is to do. He may finish
his work, to be sure. Often he finishes himself
at the same time. It would be to his advantage in
the long run, if he left the work and had his meal,
and returned to complete his duties afterwards.</p>

<p>This interference with meal-times is a fruitful
source of nervous exhaustion and breakdown.
The system is deprived of nourishment just when
it is most in need of it. Every meal postponed
under such circumstances brings the hour of
retribution nearer.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mental
effect of
hurry.</div>

<p>Apart from interference with meals, working
against time has a bad effect of its own. It is like
running for a train. A man who
could cover the same distance in
the same time without any effort
if there was no train to catch will
arrive at the station breathless.
The anxiety of getting there in time has caused
a mental disturbance, which has affected the heart
on its own account. In the same way there are
cases of nervous exhaustion and loss of health
due entirely to the habit of rushing at correspondence
in order to get it off by a certain post.
It may have to be done, but the man would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
better off in the end if he lost the business rather
than acquire it at the expense of his health.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Public work.</div>

<p>There is a peculiar strain connected with work
which demands appearing before the public. It is
pitiable to reflect how many artistes,
actors, musicians, and others break
down in their efforts to give
pleasure and diversion to the tired minds of others.</p>

<p>The reason lies in the fact of their having to
do a certain thing at a certain time, and to do
it with an audience. They must give their performance
and maintain their highest standard of
excellence, when perchance their heads are aching,
or they have got a bad cold and are only fit to
be in bed. They must be up to time, or they may
find their place occupied by another.</p>

<p>For similar reasons the parson is always vastly
more liable to breakdowns than the lawyer or
doctor. He may get up feeling tired or ill on
Sunday morning, but, except at the risk of causing
great inconvenience to others, he must put in an
appearance in the pulpit.</p>

<p>Yet there is another consideration which enters
even more largely into the question. It is that
these public appearances often interfere with
meal-times and sleep. A performance or a
meeting in the evening necessitates a delayed
supper and late hours of retiring to rest. The
nervous system is at the same time worked up
into an excited condition, so that it has its rest
and nourishment cut off just when it stands
most in need of both.</p>

<p>Much of this may, however, be avoided by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
judicious care. There have been speakers,
artistes and other public characters who have
been able to continue in harness up to an advanced
age. They have achieved this simply by strict
attention to the needs of the body. They would
fortify themselves with a good meal beforehand;
whatever else happened, they would not allow that
function to be interfered with. If they could not
get food before leaving home, they would arrange
for it to be ready for them at the rendezvous. On
arriving home again, they would give their nervous
systems the best chance by taking a meal and
then having a quiet read, with a smoke if they
were so inclined, afterwards going to bed as soon
as was compatible with their digestions.</p>

<p>Many of these may seem trivial details, yet it
is the little things of life which amount to so
much; and if these precautions are observed,
there are many weary workers in all ranks of
life who will find that labour loses much of its
drudgery. If everyone were to carry them out,
we should see fewer haggard faces and tired eyes
than we do at present. One has only to travel in
any suburban train to find out how many people
there are who go home each evening weary and
done up. This is not what life was meant to be.
Honest fatigue there will always be, but no one
objects to that. It is the jaded despondency on
the faces of so many people at the close of their
day’s work that is contrary to all principles of
humanity. It is one thing to be tired; it is a
different thing to reach home more dead than
alive, and ready to drop.</p>

<p>If people would take more care in preparing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
themselves for their daily duties, and in improving
their conditions of work, both for themselves and
their employees, we should hear very much less
of breakdowns than we do at present.</p>

<div class="sidenote">After work.</div>

<p>The way in which people spend their spare time
in the evenings is of the greatest importance. It
is their opportunity for repairing
the wear and tear of the day’s
work, and of fitting themselves to
stand the brunt of that which is to come. The
manner in which they spend it depends largely
on the nature of the day’s proceedings.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Exercise or
rest.</div>

<p>If a man has been sitting at a desk all day, he
will be all the better for a walk on returning
home. It will give him a chance
of fresh air, and the exercise will do
his cramped legs good. If, however,
he is tired in body as well as
mind, a rest is what he needs. A man was once
suffering in health, and always feeling done up.
He rarely had an appetite for his dinner in the
evening. It was all due to one thing. He was
in the habit of going for an hour’s hard walk each
evening after returning from business. He did
it with the best of motives, being impressed with
the value of exercise. He overlooked the fact
that he had had as much exercise as he could
stand already, as his work not only threw a strain
on his thinking powers, but also involved a
constant amount of standing or walking throughout
the day. When he stopped taking this duty
walk&mdash;for such it was, it gave him no pleasure,
as he was too tired to enjoy it&mdash;his health improved
by leaps and bounds.</p>

<p>There are many such persons who would feel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
vastly better, and have better appetites and
digestions, if they took a rest on reaching home,
instead of rushing off to golf or for a walk. It
would refresh them as much as exercise braces up
those who have had too little of it during the day.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Amusements.</div>

<p>As to the recreations with which people seek
to restore their lost energies, that too must vary
according to the nature of their
daily avocation. Chess is a
splendid game, there is no doubt.
Yet anyone who has had a mental
strain all day had better choose something that
demands less call on their thinking powers.
Under such circumstances we confess to a preference
for something of a lighter or more frivolous
nature. Anyhow, in whatever way people choose
to spend their evenings let it be a <em>change</em>, for in
that way alone can rest be obtained. The brain
worker had better select fiction or some such light
form of literature if he is disposed for reading.
But there are thousands of people whose work
is cut and dried, and does not involve any mental
strain, who would improve both their minds and
their sense of well-being by taking up some
reading or hobby which demands a certain
amount of application and study.</p>

<p>The great point after all is to do something,
anything rather than nothing. Not that they
can do nothing if they try, for it is an impossible
feat, as we all know. Yet the trying to do it is
the greatest effort a man can make, and tires him
out more rapidly than anything else.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER <abbr title="19">XIX.</abbr><br />
<span class="sub_head">WORRY.</span></h2>

<p>It is a true saying that worry, not work, kills.
People can get through an amazing amount of work
if they do it in a quiet and methodical manner.</p>

<p>One morning two men were walking along a
road in the direction of a railway station. One
of them was going at a steady pace, with a look
of contentment about him, as if he were enjoying
the walk. The other was hurrying along with quick,
nervous steps, occasionally looking at his watch
and breaking into a short run, while his strained
expression and panting breath formed a marked
contrast to the easy deportment of his friend.</p>

<p>They both caught the train, but while one was
cool and collected and felt invigorated for his
work when he reached the terminus, the other
was hot and flurried, and this gave him a bad
start for the day. Moreover, each of them
transacted his business in much the same way
as he had walked to the station, one doing it
quietly and methodically, while the other spent
his time in rushing from one thing to another,
taking his lunch in the fewest possible minutes,
and constantly worrying himself and everyone
else into the bargain.</p>

<p>The singular part of it was that the quiet,
steady-going man got through more work in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
day than his friend did, and years later, when
they had reached middle age, was as fit as ever
for his business, whereas the other man was
broken down by overwork, as he called it.</p>

<p>In the last chapter we considered the question
of physical and mental fatigue resulting from
work. We purposely omitted the element of
worry, which does more harm than all the other
conditions of work put together. For worry
does more than tire the mind&mdash;it demoralises it.</p>

<p>In a certain war two companies of men had to
march an equal distance in order to meet at a
particular spot. The one arrived in perfect
order, and with few signs of exhaustion, although
the march had been an arduous one. The other
company reached the place utterly done up and
disorganised. It was all a question of leadership:
the captain of the first company had
known his way and kept his men in good order,
while the captain of the second company had
never been sure of himself, and had harassed his
subordinates with a constant succession of orders
and counter-orders, until they had hardly known
whether they were on their heads or their heels.
That was why they arrived looking completely
demoralised.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Worry
and the
mind.</div>

<p>Now worry has precisely the same effect on
the mind as a bad leader has upon his men. For
the mind is not a vague mystery
“somewhere inside the head,” as it
is generally supposed to be. The
brain is a matter of tissue and
blood, the same as any other part<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
of the body. We may not know quite so much
about it, but that does not affect the question.
The workings of the mind are as definite and
practical as the movements of the fingers. The
brain cells have, stretching out from them, a
number of minute filaments. We know that the
tips of these filaments move about and touch
their neighbours. And according to the manner
in which they move, different trains of thought
are set up. The intricate network is constantly
changing its form, as the filaments link up
together various parts of the brain tissue.</p>

<p>It is, in fact, the counterpart of a telephone
system, which has wires and exchanges and call
offices extending all over the country. From
these offices telephone callers are put into communication
with each other, and there is a
never-ending linking-up and switching-off taking
place, and the harmony of the systems depends
on the efficiency of the operators. Fill one of the
exchanges with a lot of fussy, ill-trained people,
who would lose their heads, and the whole system
would be disorganised in a very short time.</p>

<p>Each man possesses his own telephone system
inside his head, and the working of it depends
entirely on himself. If he fidgets and fumes and
gets excited over what he is doing, he worries the
brain filaments until they begin to act all ways
except the right one. And not only do they fail
to carry out their purpose, but the bother and
flurry through which they pass tire them out
as no amount of steady work could ever do.
Like the men of the second company, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
get to the end of their day’s work fagged and
exhausted.</p>

<p>If this goes on long, for days and months and
years in succession, the strain becomes too great,
and they either refuse to work at all or they get
completely out of hand. And, whichever they
do, it means that the man who owns them suffers
from a breakdown. And it was the worry, not
the work, which caused it.</p>

<p>Some people have a born knack of worrying.
The mental agony through which they pass when
taking a railway journey is almost incredible.
They worry as to whether they will get to the
station in time, and if their luggage will arrive
safely at its destination, and a hundred other
things as well.</p>

<p>We once heard a lady say&mdash;almost boastfully,
she seemed proud of the fact&mdash;that she never
slept a wink all night if she was a penny out in her
household accounts. She did not say what
happened if she was a halfpenny out. We can
only presume, therefore, that in that case she
slept for half the night.</p>

<p>With worries of this sort we have no sympathy.
They can be overcome by an effort of will, and
those who give way to them had better realise
that they are not only bothering the people
around them, but endangering their own nervous
systems as well. For worry leads to worry. A
mind that is addicted to them will always tend
to distort things, making mountains out of molehills.
Objects invariably loom larger in a fog.</p>

<p>And of all troubles in this life there are none so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
hard to bear as imaginary ones. Many of us
prefer to meet a burglar rather than a ghost.
The troubles we dread rarely come. Yet the
strain of thinking about them tends to precipitate
other disasters. The man who is always on the
look-out for orange peel is very liable to run his
head against a lamp-post. If after that he is
always thinking of lamp-posts, he is almost certain
to slip on a piece of orange peel. And people
who are constantly worrying about the future,
and all the ills that it may bring with it, are
inviting troubles, for they are frittering their
energies instead of applying them to their work.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Worry and
neurasthenia.</div>

<p>Worry is a potent factor in causing neurasthenia,
and once that has come about the system is
deprived of its resisting power and
laid open to disease. And neurasthenics
are singularly prone to
forebodings. The state of the
nervous system alters the circulation in the body
to such an extent that it is apt to cause the
feeling of illness, if not illness itself. Such people
are liable to feel chilly or burning hot, even
though their temperatures may be normal. Yet
because of their sensations they feel certain
that they are going to be ill, and the dread
of this still further aggravates their nervous
condition.</p>

<p>While worry brings on neurasthenia, the latter
adds to worry. The whole process is like a snowball
rolling down a hill, increasing in size as it
does so. All the more reason, therefore, why we
should take every precaution to arrest it at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
outset, by considering in what way worry can
be prevented.</p>

<div class="sidenote">How
to prevent
worry.</div>

<p>This can never be done by running away from
responsibilities or difficulties of any sort. Such
as they may be, we must face them.
There are many people to-day, as
in the ancient time, who sigh for
the wings of a dove that they may
fly away and be at rest. Even if
they got the wings, it is doubtful if they would be
much better off. In all probability they would
find that they had gone farther only to fare
worse.</p>

<p>Neither can worry be got rid of by sitting down
and trying to make up our minds that we will not
give way to it. The seasick man might as well
command the waves to be still. We have little
direct control over the nervous system, but we
have a vast amount of influence over the movements
of the body, which reacts in such a
pronounced manner on the mind.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Body and
mind.</div>

<p>The man who walks and talks hurriedly or
jerkily tends to think in like fashion. Those
whose minds are in a fume and a
fidget usually show it by fussing
about and behave generally in a
restless manner. Let them force
themselves to walk quietly and deliberately, and
they will be surprised to find how quickly their
minds follow suit and settle down into a steadier
groove. And if they take care to speak in the
same deliberate fashion at the same time, the good
effect will be heightened. The movement of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
limbs and of the lips react on the mind to a
surprising extent.</p>

<p>If any should doubt what we have said as to the
close connection between the body and the mind,
let them try an experiment which was advocated
many years ago by a celebrated psychologist.
It consists in reading a comic book with the
features contracted into a stern frown, and
following this up by reading a pathetic one with
the face relaxed into a broad grin. The result
will convince them as to the truth of our previous
statements.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Anticipation.</div>

<p>Sometimes a man is worried to death on
account of some event he is anticipating, a reply
to some letter he has sent, or the
news of some appointment he is in
for. Often under such circumstances
he will pace up and down like a caged
beast, until the nervous tension almost makes
him ill. Try as he may, he cannot sit still.
But he can do something equally efficacious, he
can engage in some other occupation, keeping his
hands and mind employed, instead of glancing
continually at the clock or looking for the
postman.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Beset by
work.</div>

<p>And sometimes people are beset by business
until they scarcely know where to turn. Then
it may be that they become so
agitated that they can do nothing
to further the matter in hand. A
man once consulted a doctor as to
an experience that had befallen him on the
previous evening. “At teatime,” he said, “I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
found myself becoming anxious and worried as
to the amount of work in front of me. And the
harder I tried to get on with it the more obstinately
my brain refused to act, and by bedtime I had got
everything into a hopeless muddle.”</p>

<p>The doctor told him that curiously enough he
himself had had a similar experience the same
evening, and just about the same time.</p>

<p>“And what did you do?” the patient inquired,
and was much astonished when the medical man
replied, “Went out, had a couple of games of
billiards, then came back and finished it all
comfortably in a couple of hours.”</p>

<p>When a man finds that his work is worrying
him unduly, or when he is so overwhelmed by it
that he cannot keep his mental equilibrium, the
best thing he can do is to stop it for a time and
have a rest or a change of some sort, even if it is
only for a few minutes. It will facilitate the
work in the long run, and will save the nervous
system from an amount of wear and tear which
may take days or weeks to put right again.</p>

<p>Unpunctuality and untidiness are responsible for
a great amount of unnecessary worry. The man
who is habitually late in the mornings is apt to
find his work accumulate to such an extent that
by the time he ought to be finishing his day’s
work he feels it has become a heavy burden upon
his shoulders. And people who keep their desks
in an untidy condition lose a vast amount of time,
and harass themselves by having to search for
things they should have been able to put their
fingers on at once.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Stimulants.</div>

<p>Above all, let a man avoid stimulating his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
flagging brain by means of alcohol, or soothing it
by the aid of drugs. Tobacco,
however, is&mdash;in the writer’s opinion
at least&mdash;a boon to people of a
worrying disposition. If used to excess, especially
in the form of cigarettes, it may sap the nervous
system, and lead to more worry than it is likely
to prevent. Taken in moderation, and in its
healthiest form, that of a pipe, it often proves of
great benefit to tired nerves.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Leisure time.</div>

<p>It is of the utmost importance for people who
are subject to worry to pay every attention to the
way in which they spend their
leisure time. It is even more
important in their case than in
that of people who work too hard.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Overwork
compared
with worry.</div>

<p>The effect of overwork is to cause fatigue.
The mind has been kept too long in a certain
groove, until it has become wearied
from sheer exhaustion. Certain
parts of the brain or the body are
tired out for the time being. Such
persons need recreation pure and
simple. A pleasant game or a light novel is the
best remedy for their fatigue, taking the mind out
of the groove in which it has been confined.</p>

<p>The effect of worry, on the other hand, is to
produce a state of restlessness, both of mind and
body. The nervous system is in an irritable
condition, and requires something that will steady
it down. A game may only add excitement to
the restlessness. The brain is acting in an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
irregular, discursive manner, and needs some
method of treatment which will reduce it to order.
And this can best be obtained by means of a quiet
hobby. The overworked man is like a horse that
has been plodding along all day in the shafts
with a heavy weight behind it; a little freedom,
perhaps a gallop round a field, will do it more
good than anything else. The over-worried man
is like a horse that has been plunging aimlessly
around, excited and irritable: an hour’s hard
work between the shafts is what it needs.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Worries and
hobbies.</div>

<p>Therefore, while the fatigued man requires
recreation, the worried one will do better with
some hobby that needs a certain
amount of concentration. The form
of hobby best suited to him depends
on his tastes and capabilities. A
celebrated physician once told me that when he
found himself becoming worried he could quiet
his mind most speedily by mathematical problems.
They would do him far more good than any game
or other form of recreation.</p>

<p>Many people, however, might find this too
great a strain, for it is possible to be worried and
tired at the same time, as we all know. Yet
there are many hobbies which demand a certain
amount of concentration without making too
great a call on the mental faculties.</p>

<p>They may take up books on travel, for instance,
and there is no more fascinating form of reading.
Let them select some particular country, and
read all they can find about it, its inhabitants
and customs, until they are authorities on that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
subject. Or they may go in for history, studying
some particular period, and read all the manuals
and historical novels dealing with it. Continuity
is a great point in any hobby; it makes it not only
more interesting, but there is the pleasure of
knowing it is always there, waiting for them,
without their having to consider what to take
up next.</p>

<p>Or they may dip into such subjects as astronomy,
botany or a host of others. And these will do
more than refresh the mind at the time. People
of a worrying disposition are always restless and
fidgety on a railway journey, but those who take
an interest in such things as geology, flora and
fauna will find plenty to occupy their minds with
as they go along. Even railway embankments
may be made a cinematograph of delight to the
man who has studied land formations. And
anyone who is interested in architecture need
never fear the tedium of having to spend an hour
or two in a strange town waiting for the next
train.</p>

<p>Those who have a taste for poetry may consider
themselves fortunate, for there is something in the
harmony of words that has a specially beneficial
effect on the worried mind. The rhythm, either
of blank verse or rhyme, is excellently adapted
for reducing the aimless wandering of an overwrought
mind to a regular, steady running.
Especially is this the case if people take the
trouble to learn it by heart. For this acts as a
kind of mental mastication, and the poetry is
consequently absorbed and becomes a part of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
their very being. Then they are laying up for
themselves a store of treasures which they may
enjoy at any moment. People who worry are
always liable to be irritable when alone, and need
something to counteract their moody tendencies.</p>

<p>A man of this type was so subject to irritability
of this sort when he was dressing in the mornings
that he invariably started the day badly. And
a day that begins in this way is like a choir that
starts on a wrong note, it is a difficult matter to
get back to the right one again. This man,
owing to his unfortunate habit, found it almost
impossible to recover a harmonious frame of
mind, until at last he hit upon the secret. He
had become enamoured of the writings of a certain
poet, and had begun to learn whole passages by
heart. After that he found himself repeating
these to himself when he got up in the morning,
and it is no exaggeration to say that it altered his
life. It gave him a good send-off for the day,
and saved him from many a mistake and many
a worry.</p>

<p>A hobby which combines hand and eye and
brain is of great service to a flurried mind.
Engineers, carpenters and all who are engaged in
like occupations unconsciously acquire an orderly,
methodical way of thinking.</p>

<p>As to what form of manual work people take
up their individual tastes will decide, just as
much as in the kind of reading they indulge in.
If they have a faculty for art, they can take up
painting or music. And when I say music, I
mean practising it properly, not simply sitting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
down to the piano to improvise or wander from
piece to piece. It is the steady practice which
does the brain good.</p>

<p>Or they may prefer carpentry or wood carving,
or preparing microscopic slides, than which there
is no more absorbing hobby. There are scores
of others, too, equally interesting.</p>

<p>Nothing, however trivial, is beneath our notice,
if it will in any way mitigate this deadly habit of
worrying, which has such a detrimental influence
on the nervous system, and so often is responsible
both for the starting-point and the climax of a
breakdown.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER <abbr title="20">XX.</abbr><br />
<span class="sub_head">THE STRONG MAN.</span></h2>

<div class="sidenote">What
strength is.</div>

<p>The strength of a chain lies in its weakest link,
and the measure of man’s strength is that of the
weak point in his constitution.
He may have the frame and muscle
of a Sandow, but if he has a faulty
valve in his heart, it is by that,
and not by his muscular development, that his
strength must be gauged. Even supposing that
every organ in his body is sound, and he is
possessed of great powers of endurance, he cannot
be called strong if he is impairing his digestion
by careless habits of eating and drinking, or
endangering his nervous system by habitually
keeping late hours and burning the candle at
both ends, or laying up gout in store for himself
by gourmandising or want of exercise.</p>

<p>No matter whether the weak spot be in the
man’s own system or in his mode of life, Nature
will find it out as surely as the arrow found the
heel of Achilles. It is on his weak points that he
must stand or fall; it is in these that the strain
will manifest itself, in other words, that the
breakdown will appear.</p>

<p>The aim of this book has been to prevent
matters ever reaching this stage, to arrest them
at the outset. No sign, of all those I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
indicated as pointing towards a breakdown,
should be neglected. The time to take heed is
when any man or woman finds that their powers
of work are failing them, their nerves easily
upset, or their minds assailed by an unreasonable
dread of the future, or that in one or other of
various ways they are not the people they were.
It is better to slow down at the first danger signal
than to run past one after another until we are
pulled up with a crash.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Find out
the weak
points.</div>

<p>The first thing, therefore, is to find out the
weak points; take care of these, and the strong
ones will look after themselves.
The man who taps the wheels of
railway carriages does so in order
to detect flaws; he passes by the
sound wheels with indifference.
And there is a simple way in which people may
find out in which particulars they are going wrong.
If they have taken the trouble to wade through
this book, they may have noticed that certain
paragraphs or chapters attracted their attention.
It does not follow that they agreed with them,
or thought them important at the time. It may
be that they said (provided they were of the
male gender) that they were “all nonsense,” or
that it was “a precious lot of fuss about nothing.”</p>

<p>It does not matter what they said or thought.
The point is that they said or thought something.
For the fact that they did so was proof that the
piece of writing in question forced itself upon
their notice, and must therefore have had some
special application to their own case; and if this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
has been so, let them pay particular heed to those
paragraphs, or pages or chapters, whichever they
may have been.</p>

<p>If the advice given is not in accordance with
their own feelings, that fact does not detract from
its value. Many of us, in looking back, have to
acknowledge that most of the warnings and
counsels which have proved of the greatest
benefit in the long run, were unpalatable at the
time. They were distasteful simply because we
knew in our inmost hearts that we stood in
need of them. Otherwise we should not have
paid sufficient attention to them even to feel any
resentment on the subject. There is a lot of
meaning in the saying, “Greater truth, greater
libel.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Temperament.</div>

<p>Especially does this apply to the question of
exercise and rest. It is not hard, as a rule, to
convince people that they are
committing errors of diet, or getting
too little fresh air; but it is very
different when we come to deal
with these other matters. Few people like to be
told that they should take more exercise, or rouse
themselves to show more interest in things outside
their ordinary routine of work. It sounds like an
accusation of indolence.</p>

<p>Yet such resentment is slight compared with
that of the men or women who have to be warned
that they are wasting their energies by restlessness
and worry or lack of recreation. These strenuous
natures are apt to take umbrage at the fact
of their work being interfered with. They do not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
realise that what we wish is that they may be
enabled to do better work and more of it in
the end.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Man, know
thyself.</div>

<p>When a medical man sees a patient he has to do
more than diagnose the disease. Often it happens
that before he can find out what is
the matter, and certainly before he
can treat it efficiently, he must
discover what type of man or
woman he is dealing with. Any coachman will
tell you that before he can drive a horse well he
must get to know the animal itself. For some are
restless and excitable and need the curb, whilst
others are lazy and require the use of the whip.
And for all who wish to guide themselves in
matters of health it is of the first importance that
they should know their own temperaments.</p>

<p>It is said that people are always the last to hear
any gossip or scandal about themselves. It is
equally true that they are usually the last to
observe any change in their health or dispositions.
A person may be growing thinner, paler, and more
tired looking, and yet be unaware of the fact.
Much more does this apply to all the nervous
symptoms and other peculiarities which denote
that he is on the down-grade and gliding towards
a breakdown. Yet if any such signs are pointed
out to him by others, either by a medical man
or some candid friend, the best thing he can do is to
give full consideration to their opinion. Let
health be preserved while it can. The day may
come when it will be lost never to be regained.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Adjusting
the mind.</div>

<p>Throughout this book we have laid stress on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
influence of the body on the mind, and the
importance of attending to its
various functions in order to keep
the nervous system healthy. Yet
we must not overlook the other
fact, viz. that we are gifted with a certain, even
if limited, amount of control over the mind
itself.</p>

<p>Some writers have told us, and quite rightly too,
that we can cultivate a brighter outlook on the
future. We are recommended to persuade ourselves
that there is no season in the whole year
so acceptable as the one that is just commencing&mdash;no
beauty like that of spring, no glory like that
of summer, no time so welcome as autumn with its
dying splendours. And when winter comes
we can look forward to the delights of the cosy
fireside, so much more sociable than the long,
garish days of summer. Instead of which, too
many of us dread the heat and the cold and
a good many other things, that are never so
bad when they come as we think they are going
to be.</p>

<p>A little calm philosophy undoubtedly goes a
long way towards negotiating many of the
difficulties and anxieties with which we are all
confronted at times. Yet it is impossible to
acquire a cheerful, philosophical frame of mind
unless the body, with its nervous system and
various organs, is in a healthy condition. After
all, the chief thing is to attend to its requirements.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The secret
of preventing
breakdowns.</div>

<p>When all is said and done, we come back to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
elementary rules of health. It is around these
that the whole question of breakdowns
hinges. On the observance
of them depend both the prevention
and cure of this condition. If they
were always carried out, this dire
calamity would rarely, if ever, happen. When
once it has loomed ahead there is only one thing
to be done. The man or woman who sees it
threatening them must retrace their steps and get
back to the place where they took the wrong
turning. They must work their way back until
they have regained the health and vigour, which
they once enjoyed but forfeited through their
neglect of those laws.</p>

<p>And this needs a vast amount of patience and
perseverance. It is easier to slide down than to
climb up again, and people may find their progress
marred by many a set-back. Yet a backward
step in an upward climb does not mean that we have
rolled to the bottom of the hill again. Many a
man is discouraged when, after months of patient
striving, he finds one day that his symptoms have
returned&mdash;his nervousness, his inability to tackle
his work, his feeling of langour and debility, or
whatever else it may be. He thinks that all his
efforts have been of no avail, and that he might as
well give up.</p>

<p>He need not lose heart, it is but a temporary
lapse. In a few days he will find himself climbing
up once more. And if he holds on bravely he will
one day reach the summit, and enjoy to the full
the health and strength and energy of his earlier<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
years. He will then have obtained his reward
in the possession of that treasure which is greater
than wealth or fame.</p>

<p>We cannot do better than conclude with words
penned by a discerning writer more than two
centuries ago:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Health is that which makes your meat and
drink both savoury and pleasant. It is that
which makes your bed easy and your sleep
refreshing; that revives your strength with the
rising sun, and makes you rejoice to behold
the light of another day. Health is that which
fills up the uneven parts of your body, making
it plump and comely; which makes your mind
fertile, and preserves the vigour, verdure, and
beauty of your youth. ’Tis that which makes
the soul take delight in her mansion, and adorns
your face with glowing colours. Good health
takes no notice of heart, lungs, stomach or
nerves. Indeed, it does not know that there are
such things.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The most wonderful feature of perfect health
is its blissful unconsciousness.</p>
